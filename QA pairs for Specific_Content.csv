Question,Specific Content,Ground Truth
Who is the owner of this malware?,"we reported about a MOVEit Transfer vulnerability that was actively being exploited. If your organization uses MOVEit Transfer and you haven’t patched yet, it really is time to move it. Excuse the bad pun, but yesterday we saw the first victims of this vulnerability come forward. MOVEit Transfer is a widely used file transfer software which encrypts files and uses secure File Transfer Protocols to transfer data. As such, it has a large userbase in healthcare, education, US federal and state government, and financial institutions. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database lists publicly disclosed computer security flaws. On Friday the CVE had not been assigned yet, but now this vulnerability has now been listed as: CVE-2023-34362: In Progress MOVEit Transfer before 2021.0.6 (13.0.6), 2021.1.4 (13.1.4), 2022.0.4 (14.0.4), 2022.1.5 (14.1.5), and 2023.0.1 (15.0.1), a SQL injection vulnerability has been found in the MOVEit Transfer web application that could allow an unauthenticated attacker to gain access to MOVEit Transfer’s database. Depending on the database engine being used (MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, or Azure SQL), an attacker may be able to infer information about the structure and contents of the database, and execute SQL statements that alter or delete database elements. NOTE: this is exploited in the wild in May and June 2023; exploitation of unpatched systems can occur via HTTP or HTTPS. All versions (e.g., 2020.0 and 2019x) before the five explicitly mentioned versions are affected, including older unsupported versions. Microsoft says that the group behind the attacks on MOVEit instances is the Lace Tempest group, which is a known ransomware operator and runs the extortion website Cl0p. This was confirmed by a Cl0p representative to Bleeping Computer, who also said that the criminals started exploiting the vulnerability on May 27th, during the US Memorial Day holiday. We saw a similar scenario unfold in March which caused Cl0p to occupy the first place as most used ransomware in our Ransomware Review for that month. Contributing to Cl0p’s rise to the number one spot was its extensive GoAnywhere campaign. The group successfully breached over 104 organizations by taking advantage of a zero-day vulnerability in the widely-used managed file transfer software, GoAnywhere MFT. As we have pointed out before, ransomware gangs can afford to play the long game now. And some of them do. When you have hundreds or maybe even thousands of victims to choose from, you start with the juiciest ones that are most likely to pay. Payroll provider Zellis who serves British Airways and the BBC would be a good example of that. Pharmacy chain Boots, which employs more than 57,000 people in the UK and Ireland, has also announced that it has been impacted. A Reuters reporter that has an inside contact in the Cl0p ransomware gang tweeted a screenshot of his contact saying that the military, gov(ernment), children’s hospitals, and police would not be attacked. The same was repeated by BleepingComputer’s contact. But this is no guarantee, and in the end they may not be able to resist the urge to steal data from those networks anyway. All this means that if your organization uses MOVEit Transfer and it is internet facing, you should assume that your network has been breached. The fact that you haven’t noticed anything yet probably means you are low on the list of desirable targets. It does NOT mean you got away lucky and simply patching the vulnerability is enough. First of all, MOVEit Transfer users should visit the Progress security bulletin about this vulnerability and bookmark it. You can find the latest advice, Indicators of Compromise (IOCs), affected versions, and available patches there. Basically the advice, and you can find detailed instructions on the page, is to: Additionally, users of MOVEit Transfer with Microsoft Azure integration should take immediate action to rotate their Azure storage keys. In our previous post about this vulnerability I mentioned a few tools to help you find the malicious artifacts: Malwarebytes detects the malicious webshell C:MOVEitTransferwwwroothuman2.aspx as Exploit.Silock.MOVEit and blocks five malicious IP addresses—138.197.152.201, 209.97.137.33, 5.252.191.0/24, 148.113.152.144, 89.39.105.108—that were found to be looking for vulnerable systems.

Who/What is the tool linked to?,"Organizations of all sizes need to protect their information assets from ransomware attacks. This is especially critical for large enterprises with scores of servers, workstations, and users—all of which need protection from ransomware attacks. Read on to learn about signs of ransomware attacks and how a managed security service provider (MSSP) can help spot them.   The dangers and impact of ransomware cannot be overstated. Your organization must be vigilant about maintaining capabilities to protect against it. This year’s global losses due to ransomware are estimated at $20 billion. These attacks’ most common indicators include: Below, we’ll describe the signs of each indicator and pose a question about your capacity to identify it internally. Your answers to these questions will determine whether you need a MSSP. When computers or other devices on your network are slow to process, you may think it’s because there are too many users depleting bandwidth. A closer look at your network and storage may reveal that there is actually no reasonable cause for the reduction in speed. Ransomware starts its journey scanning networks for file storage locations. This silent survey slows down traffic, frustrating your workforce. It’s also one of the early signs of ransomware. Any slowdown, regardless of reason or impact, needs to be marked as a cybersecurity event. While not necessarily an attack or incident, it’s a potential indicator of a larger problem. So, the critical question to ask of your security staff and systems is:     Another troublesome sign you may encounter is the sudden appearance of changes to files or even entire folders in your organization. Common file extensions used for routine processes include .pdf, .doc or .docx, and .jpeg. If you notice files without an extension, or with an unconventional one, and you’re uncertain the changes were authorized, you’ve encountered a sign of cyberattack. File integrity is the goal of your change management program, where all expected changes are tracked and approved. Suspicious file changes should be detected and examined as soon as they occur. Accordingly, a critical question to ask of your current staff is:   When your team notices several files go missing over a period of time, a ransomware attack is likely at hand. Remember, the attacker intends to move about your network undetected for as long as it takes to remove as much critical data as possible. They may test the waters with fewer or less critical files at first, then move onto bigger targets once they know they can. In light of these potential impacts of file extraction, your team should ask itself:   Encrypting files is an effective way to protect your data at rest and in transit. However, this is only true when the encryption is done by an authorized capacity within your organization and applied to files that need to be encrypted for a regulatory or other requirement. Mis-application of encryption can compromise data availability; it’s also a potential indicator of ransomware. Managing an encryption program requires prioritizing data based on impact to the organization and ensuring cryptography is applied efficiently and appropriately. Assessing your networks, if the team notices encrypted files on your network that no one has knowledge of or accountability for, you’ve likely discovered signs of cyberattack. Pay especially close attention to files with extensions such as .crytped or .cryptor—when detected, they should set off an alarm to act. For this indicator, a critical question to ask of your internal systems and staff is:   The most obvious indicator of ransomware is often the most dangerous: an explicit message that tells one or more team members about the existence of malware on their computer. Team members in any organization risk logging in to their computer and seeing a graphic or plain text on the screen announcing that files critical to your business have been stolen, encrypted, deleted, or otherwise compromised. Most often, this same text will instruct its reader to pay a certain sum of money to the attackers to release the files, within an urgently short timeframe. This sign is likely the last to appear, after others above have been neglected or left unnoticed. There is no real trick to identifying this sign; instead, it’s critical to reduce the likelihood that it appears. The answers to the questions above should indicate whether your team is able to do so on its own, or if security program advisory or program oversight (i.e. a vCISO) is needed. Let’s return to the questions posed above about the first four, insidious signs of ransomware: RSI Security offers a variety of individual and bundled services as an MSSP. We’ll optimize your defenses through program advisory, architecture implementation, and cybersecurity training to educate all personnel, making it easier to identify and address the indicators detailed above. Watch the full webinar! To recap from above, the primary signs of ransomware attack most organizations need to watch out for are suspicious slowdowns and file changes, unauthorized or alien instances of extraction or encryption, and the dreaded splash-screen message directly announcing an attack. To spot these in due time and respond to them accordingly, many organizations turn to MSSPs to install or supplement existing cybersecurity protections.

Who is this malware linked to/owned by?,"International TECHNICALOVERVIEW Read how a customer deployed a data protection program to 40,000 users in less than 120 days. DEFINITIVE GUIDETO DLP Digital Guardian's Blog by Nate Lord on Monday November 21, 2016 Learn about indicators of compromise and their role in detection and response in Data Protection 101, our series on the fundamentals of information security. Indicators of compromise (IOCs) are “pieces of forensic data, such as data found in system log entries or files, that identify potentially malicious activity on a system or network.” Indicators of compromise aid information security and IT professionals in detecting data breaches, malware infections, or other threat activity. By monitoring for indicators of compromise, organizations can detect attacks and act quickly to prevent breaches from occurring or limit damages by stopping attacks in earlier stages. Indicators of compromise act as breadcrumbs that lead infosec and IT pros to detect malicious activity early in the attack sequence. These unusual activities are the red flags that indicate a potential or in-progress attack that could lead to a data breach or systems compromise. But, IOCs are not always easy to detect; they can be as simple as metadata elements or incredibly complex malicious code and content samples. Analysts often identify various IOCs to look for correlation and piece them together to analyze a potential threat or incident. Indicators of attack are similar to IOCs, but rather than focusing on forensic analysis of a compromise that has already taken place, indicators of attack focus on identifying attacker activity while an attack is in process. Indicators of compromise help answer the question “What happened?” while indicators of attack can help answer questions like “What is happening and why?” A proactive approach to detection uses both IOAs and IOCs to discover security incidents or threats in as close to real time as possible. There are several indicators of compromise that organizations should monitor. In an article for DarkReading, Ericka Chickowski highlights 15 key indicators of compromise: Monitoring for indicators of compromise enables organizations to better detect and respond to security compromises. Collecting and correlating IOCs in real time means that organizations can more quickly identify security incidents that may have gone undetected by other tools and provides the necessary resources to perform forensic analysis of incidents. If security teams discover recurrence or patterns of specific IOCs they can update their security tools and policies to protect against future attacks as well. There is a push for organizations to report these analyses results in a consistent, well-structured manner to help companies and IT professionals automate the processes used in detecting, preventing, and reporting security incidents. Some in the industry argue that documenting IOCs and threats helps organizations and individuals share information among the IT community as well as improve incident response and computer forensics. The OpenIOC framework is one way to consistently describe the results of malware analysis. Other groups such as STIX and TAXII are making efforts to standardize IOC documentation and reporting. Indicators of compromise are an important component in the battle against malware and cyberattacks. While they are reactive in nature, organizations that monitor for IOCs diligently and keep up with the latest IOC discoveries and reporting can improve detection rates and response times significantly.

Learn morearrow_forward Get Started   UNC2452 UNC2452 is a sophisticated group that has targeted government and private sector entities worldwide. They have employed many unique capabilities, including gaining initial access through a software supply chain vulnerability. After gaining access to a victim network, UNC2452 has a light malware footprint, often using legitimate credentials to access data and move laterally. The U.S. government attributed the SolarWinds supply chain compromise which we track as UNC2452 to the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR). Mandiant Threat Intelligence assesses that UNC2452 activity aligns with nation-state priorities broadly and that the group’s targeting patterns are consistent with Russian strategic interests. Navigating the UNC2452 Intrusion Campaign UNC1878 UNC1878 is a financially motivated group that monetizes their intrusions by extorting their victims following the deployment of RYUK ransomware. As of September 2020, Mandiant has increasingly observed KEGTAP campaigns as the initial infection vector for UNC1878 operations; previously, UNC1878 used TrickBot for initial access. UNC1878 has used various offensive security tools, most commonly Cobalt Strike BEACON, along with legitimate tools and built-in commands such as PSEXEC, WMI, and BITSadmin. Additional Resources UNC1945 UNC1945 is a group that has been observed targeting a number of organizations in the telecommunications, financial, and business services industries since at least early 2018. The goal of UNC1945 is currently unknown because Mandiant has not been able to observe the activities that followed UNC1945 compromises. Based on available information Mandiant has not been able to assess a general location that the group operates from. Additional Resources UNC2529 UNC2529 is a well-resourced and experienced group that has targeted multiple organizations across numerous industries in a global phishing campaign. They have used phishing emails containing inline links to malicious URLs hosting DOUBLEDRAG malware, a highly obfuscated Javascript downloader. UNC2529 has also used weaponized Microsoft Excel documents as a first stage downloader. DOUBLEDRAG attempts to download a second-stage obfuscated PowerShell memory-only dropper, which Mandiant tracks as DOUBLEDROP, that will launch a backdoor into memory. This third-stage backdoor is tracked as DOUBLEBACK. UNC2529 displayed indications of target research based on their selection of sender email addresses and subject lines which were tailored to their intended victims. Although Mandiant has no data on the objectives of this threat actor, their broad targeting across industries and geographies is consistent with a targeting calculus most commonly seen among financially motivated groups. UNC2639 UNC2639 was first identified exploiting multiple zero-day vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange in early March 2021. This actor uses these vulnerabilities to deploy webshells including CHINACHOP.  ","UNC2452, UNC1878, UNC1945, UNC2529, UNC2639"

UK, EU, US and allies have announced that Russia is responsible for a series of cyber-attacks since the renewed invasion of Ukraine. Russia has been behind a series of cyber-attacks since the start of the renewed invasion of Ukraine, the EU, UK, US and other allies have announced today (10 May). The most recent attack on communications company Viasat in Ukraine had a wider impact across the continent, disrupting wind farms and internet users in central Europe. The UK’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) assesses that the Russian Military Intelligence was almost certainly involved in the 13 January defacements of Ukrainian government websites and the deployment of Whispergate destructive malware. The NCSC also assesses that it is almost certain Russia was responsible for the subsequent cyber-attack impacting Viasat on 24 February. On 24 February, a cyber-attack against Viasat began approximately 1 hour before Russia launched its major invasion of Ukraine. Although the primary target is believed to have been the Ukrainian military, other customers were affected, including personal and commercial internet users. Wind farms in central Europe and internet users were also affected. Viasat has said that “tens of thousands of terminals have been damaged, made inoperable and cannot be repaired.” Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said: This is clear and shocking evidence of a deliberate and malicious attack by Russia against Ukraine which had significant consequences on ordinary people and businesses in Ukraine and across Europe. We will continue to call out Russia’s malign behaviour and unprovoked aggression across land, sea and cyberspace, and ensure it faces severe consequences. Today’s announcement comes as cyber security leaders from the 5 Eyes, EU and international allies meet at the NCSC’s Cyber UK conference in Newport to discuss the cyber threats facing the world. The UK has already sanctioned the GRU after their appalling actions in Salisbury, and has frozen more than £940 billion worth of bank assets and £117 billion in personal net worth from oligarchs and their family members who fund Putin’s war machine.

Who is the target of this threat actor?,"Reuters has published new information on this incident, which initially matches the proposed scenario. You can find the update  at the bottom of this post. ------ February 24th: at the same time Russia initiated a full-scale attack on Ukraine, tens of thousands of KA-SAT SATCOM terminals suddenly stopped working in several european countries: Germany, Ukraine, Greece, Hungary, Poland...Germany's Enercon moved forward and acknowledged that approximately 5800 of its wind turbines, presumably those remotely operated via a SATCOM link in central Europe, had lost contact with their SCADA server.  In the affected countries, a significant part of the customers of Eutelsat's domestic broadband service were also unable to access Internet.  From the very beginning Eutelsat and its parent company Viasat, stated that the issue was being investigated as a cyberattack. Since then, details have been scarcely provided but few days ago I came across a really interesting video in the following tweet. In the video, the Commander General Michel Friedling confirms that the incident was originated by a cyberattack. However, he also provides a key detail that has the potential to turn a boring DDoS scenario, as some initially pointed out, into something much more interesting: ""the terminals have been damaged, made inoperable and probably cannot be repaired"" Based on the information publicly available and my experience researching into SATCOM terminals I'll try to present a plausible explanation for such a destructive attack.  Please note that this is merely a speculative exercise, although backed by a realistic technical reasoning...anyway probably I'm totally wrong. Back in 2014 and then in 2018 I presented at BlackHat USA two different papers mainly focused on evaluating the security posture of multiple SATCOM terminals, by uncovering a plethora of vulnerabilities and real-world scenarios across different sectors. Within these papers the reader can find an introduction to the SATCOM architecture, threat scenarios and some technical terms that will be used during this blog post. 2014 - A Wake-Up call for SATCOM Security 2018 - Last Call for SATCOM Security  In the ground segment of the KA-SAT  infrastructure we find 10 gateways distributed across Europe. Please note that the Berlin Gateway is the closest one to Ukraine. Coincidentally, Germany seems to have suffered one the worst parts of the attack. The satellite coverage is divided into the 82 spot beams, each of them is approximately 300km of diameter. As it can be seen in the following image, there are four types of spot beams which enable approximately 240 MHz in both directions (independently for the Forward and Return channels), thus allowing to re-use the slots of available frequencies (1.95 GHz in total, ~((240Mhz*2)*4)) under different polarizations. This throughput requires using multiple Gateway Earth Stations, geographically separated, for properly providing the service. An important detail is that the mappings between the spot beams and the gateways are fixed: each gateway handles a set of 10 different beams. ","The target of this threat actor appears to be the KA-SAT SATCOM terminals in several European countries including Germany, Ukraine, Greece, Hungary, and Poland. The attack also affected Germany’s Enercon, causing approximately 5800 of its wind turbines to lose contact with their SCADA server."
Who is the target of this malware?,"Complete protection for your devices, online privacy & identity Combines security, performance & privacy features in one app Enhanced protection with device performance booster Flexible parental controls & & GPS tracker for your kids The private and secure VPN to enjoy the Internet without compromising on speed Bank-grade security vault for your passwords & documents One honeypot definition comes from the world of espionage, where Mata Hari-style spies who use a romantic relationship as a way to steal secrets are described as setting a ‘honey trap’ or ‘honeypot’. Often, an enemy spy is compromised by a honey trap and then forced to hand over everything he/she knows. In computer security terms, a cyber honeypot works in a similar way, baiting a trap for hackers. It's a sacrificial computer system that’s intended to attract cyberattacks, like a decoy. It mimics a target for hackers, and uses their intrusion attempts to gain information about cybercriminals and the way they are operating or to distract them from other targets. The honeypot looks like a real computer system, with applications and data, fooling cybercriminals into thinking it's a legitimate target. For example, a honeypot could mimic a company's customer billing system - a frequent target of attack for criminals who want to find credit card numbers. Once the hackers are in, they can be tracked, and their behavior assessed for clues on how to make the real network more secure. Honeypots are made attractive to attackers by building in deliberate security vulnerabilities. For instance, a honeypot might have ports that respond to a port scan or weak passwords. Vulnerable ports might be left open to entice attackers into the honeypot environment, rather than the more secure live network. A honeypot isn't set up to address a specific problem, like a firewall or anti-virus. Instead, it's an information tool that can help you understand existing threats to your business and spot the emergence of new threats. With the intelligence obtained from a honeypot, security efforts can be prioritized and focused. Different types of honeypot can be used to identify different types of threats. Various honeypot definitions are based on the threat type that's addressed. All of them have a place in a thorough and effective cybersecurity strategy. Email traps or spam traps place a fake email address in a hidden location where only an automated address harvester will be able to find it. Since the address isn't used for any purpose other than the spam trap, it's 100% certain that any mail coming to it is spam. All messages which contain the same content as those sent to the spam trap can be automatically blocked, and the source IP of the senders can be added to a denylist. A decoy database can be set up to monitor software vulnerabilities and spot attacks exploiting insecure system architecture or using SQL injection, SQL services exploitation, or privilege abuse. A malware honeypot mimics software apps and APIs to invite malware attacks. The characteristics of the malware can then be analyzed to develop anti-malware software or to close vulnerabilities in the API. A spider honeypot is intended to trap webcrawlers ('spiders') by creating web pages and links only accessible to crawlers. Detecting crawlers can help you learn how to block malicious bots, as well as ad-network crawlers. By monitoring traffic coming into the honeypot system, you can assess: Another honeypot definition looks at whether a honeypot is high-interaction or low-interaction. Low-interaction honeypots use fewer resources and collect basic information about the level and type of threat and where it is coming from. They are easy and quick to set up, usually with just some basic simulated TCP and IP protocols and network services. But there's nothing in the honeypot to engage the attacker for very long, and you won't get in-depth information on their habits or on complex threats. On the other hand, high-interaction honeypots aim to get hackers to spend as much time as possible within the honeypot, giving plenty of information about their intentions and targets, as well as the vulnerabilities they are exploiting and their modus operandi. Think of it as a honeypot with added ‘glue’ - databases, systems, and processes that can engage an attacker for much longer. This enables researchers to track where attackers go in the system to find sensitive information, what tools they use to escalate privileges or what exploits they use to compromise the system. High-interaction honeypots are, however, resource-hungry. It is more difficult and time-consuming to set them up and to monitor them. They can also create a risk; if they’re not secured with a 'honeywall', a really determined and cunning hacker could use a high-interaction honeypot to attack other internet hosts or to send spam from a compromised machine. Both types of honeypot have a place in honeypot cybersecurity. Using a blend of both, you can refine the basic information on threat types that comes from the low-interaction honeypots by adding information on intentions, communications, and exploits from the high-interaction honeypot. By using cyber honeypots to create a threat intelligence framework, a business can ensure that it's targeting its cybersecurity spend at the right places and can see where it has security weak points. Honeypots can be a good way to expose vulnerabilities in major systems. For instance, a honeypot can show the high level of threat posed by attacks on IoT devices. It can also suggest ways in which security could be improved. Using a honeypot has several advantages over trying to spot intrusion in the real system. For instance, by definition, a honeypot shouldn't get any legitimate traffic, so any activity logged is likely to be a probe or intrusion attempt. That makes it much easier to spot patterns, such as similar IP addresses (or IP addresses all coming from one country) being used to carry out a network sweep. By contrast, such tell-tale signs of an attack are easy to lose in the noise when you are looking at high levels of legitimate traffic on your core network. The big advantage of using honeypot security is that these malicious addresses might be the only ones you see, making the attack much easier to identify. Because honeypots handle very limited traffic, they are also resource light. They don't make great demands on hardware; it's possible to set up a honeypot using old computers that you don’t use anymore. As for software, a number of ready-written honeypots are available from online repositories, further reducing the amount of in-house effort that's necessary to get a honeypot up and running. Honeypots have a low false positive rate.  That’s in stark contrast to traditional intrusion-detection systems (IDS) which can produce a high level of false alerts. Again, that helps prioritize efforts and keeps the resource demand from a honeypot at a low level. (In fact, by using the data collected by honeypots and correlating it with other system and firewall logs, the IDS can be configured with more relevant alerts, to produce fewer false positives. In that way, honeypots can help refine and improve other cybersecurity systems.) Honeypots can give you reliable intelligence about how threats are evolving. They deliver information about attack vectors, exploits, and malware - and in the case of email traps, about spammers and phishing attacks. Hackers continually refine their intrusion techniques; a cyber honeypot helps to spot newly emerging threats and intrusions. A good use of honeypots helps to eradicate blind spots, too. Honeypots are also great training tools for technical security staff. A honeypot is a controlled and safe environment for showing how attackers work and examining different types of threats. With a honeypot, security staff won't be distracted by real traffic using the network - they'll be able to focus 100% on the threat. Honeypots can also catch internal threats. Most organizations spend their time defending the perimeter, and ensuring outsiders and intruders can't get in. But if you only defend the perimeter, any hacker who has successfully gotten past your firewall has carte blanche to do whatever damage they can now that they're inside. Firewalls also won't help against an internal threat - an employee who wants to steal files before quitting their job, for instance. A honeypot can give you equally good information about internal threats and show vulnerabilities in such areas as permissions that allow insiders to exploit the system. Finally, by setting up a honeypot you're actually being altruistic, and helping other computer users. The longer hackers spend wasting their effort on honeypots, the less time they have available for hacking live systems and causing real damage - to you or to others. While honeypot cybersecurity will help chart the threat environment, honeypots won't see everything that is going on - only activity that's directed at the honeypot. Just because a certain threat hasn't been directed against the honeypot, you can't assume it doesn't exist; it's important to keep up with IT security news, not just rely on honeypots to notify you of the threats. A good, properly configured honeypot will deceive attackers into believing that they've gained access to the real system. It will have the same login warning messages, the same data fields, even the same look and feel and logos as your real systems. However, if an attacker manages to identify it as a honeypot, they can then proceed to attack your other systems while leaving the honeypot untouched. Once a honeypot has been 'fingerprinted', an attacker can create spoofed attacks to distract attention from a real exploit being targeted against your production systems. They can also feed bad information to the honeypot. Worse still, a smart attacker could potentially use a honeypot as a way into your systems. That's why honeypots can never replace adequate security controls, such as firewalls and other intrusion detection systems. Since a honeypot could serve as a launch pad for further intrusion, ensure all honeypots are well secured. A 'honeywall' can provide basic honeypot security and stop attacks directed against the honeypot from ever getting into your live system. A honeypot should give you information to help prioritize your cybersecurity efforts - but it can't replace proper cybersecurity. However many honeypots you have, consider a package like Kaspersky's Endpoint Security Cloud to protect your business assets. (Kaspersky uses its own honeypots to detect internet threats, so you don't have to.) Overall, the benefits of using honeypots far outweigh the risks.

Who is the target of this campaign?,"This blog was jointly written with Alejandro Prada and Ofer Caspi. SeroXen is a new Remote Access Trojan (RAT) that showed up in late 2022 and is becoming more popular in 2023. Advertised as a legitimate tool that gives access to your computers undetected, it is being sold for only $30 for a monthly license or $60 for a lifetime bundle, making it accessible. Quasar RAT is a legitimate open-source remote administration tool. It is offered on github page to provide user support or employee monitoring. It has been historically associated with malicious activity performed by threat actors, APT groups (like in this Mandiant report from 2017), or government attacks (in this report by Unit42 in 2017). It was first released in July 2014 as “xRAT” and renamed to “Quasar” in August 2015. Since then, there have been released updates to the code until v1.4.1 in March 2023, which is the most current version. As an open-source RAT tool with updates 9 years after its creation, it is no surprise that it continues to be a common tool used by itself or combined with other payloads by threat actors up to this day. In a review of the most recent samples, a new Quasar variant was observed by Alien Labs in the wild: SeroXen. This new RAT is a modified branch of the open-source version, adding some modifications features to the original RAT. They’re selling it for monthly or lifetime fee. Figure 1 contains some of the features advertised on their website. Figure 1. SeroXen features announced on its website. This new RAT first showed up on a Twitter account, established in September 2022. The person advertising the RAT appeared to be an English-speaking teenager. The same Twitter handle published a review of the RAT on YouTube. The video approached the review from an attacking/Red Team point of view, encouraging people to buy the tool because it is worth the money. They were claiming to be a reseller of the tool. In December 2022, a specific domain was registered to market/sell the tool, seroxen[.]com. The RAT was distributed via a monthly license for $30 USD or a lifetime license of $60 USD. It was around that time that the malware was first observed in the wild, appearing with 0 detections on VirusTotal. After a few months, on the 1st of February, the YouTuber CyberSec Zaado published a video alerting the community about the capabilities of the RAT from a defensive perspective. In late February, the RAT was advertised on social media platforms such as TikTok, Twitter, YouTube, and several cracking forums, including hackforums. There were some conversations on gaming forums complaining about being infected by malware after downloading some video games. The artifacts described by the users matched with SeroXen RAT. The threat actor updated the domain name to seroxen[.]net by the end of March. This domain name was registered on March 27th, 2023, after seroxen[.]com was decommissioned. The threat actor used GoDaddy for registration and Cloudflare for hosting the website. These domains are only used for selling and marketing purposes, and not for Command and Control (C&C) communications. Figure 2: SeroXen website Based on the packed versions uploaded to VT, it appears that the RAT is being used for targeting video game users. Several lure injector cheat files have been observed with names invoking popular videogames such as Fortnite, Valorant, Roblox or Warzone2. The threat actor used Discord for the distribution of some of the samples. Figure 3. SeroXen timeline. One of the most relevant announced features is that it is a fully undetectable version. This is currently true from a static analysis point of view, since the RAT is packaged into an obfuscated PowerShell batch file. The file's size typically ranges between 12-14 megabytes, as we can see in sample 8ace121fae472cc7ce896c91a3f1743d5ccc8a389bc3152578c4782171c69e87 uploaded to VT on May 21. Due to its relatively large size, certain antivirus may choose not to analyze it, potentially bypassing detection. This sample currently has 0 detections on VT, but some of the crowdsourced Sigma Rules do detect the activity as suspicious. As the malware is fileless and executed only in memory after going through several decryptions and decompression routines, it is more difficult to detect by antiviruses. In addition, its rootkit loads a fresh copy of ntdll.dll, which makes it harder to detect by Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR) solutions that hook into it to detect process injections. Regarding the dynamic analysis, it is worth noting that some sandbox environments might fail to detect the RAT due to its utilization of several techniques to evade virtualization and sandbox detection mechanisms and string encryption subsequent payloads. The RAT employs anti-debugging techniques by leveraging Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to identify the system's manufacturer. This enables it to identify virtualization environments such as VMware and abort the execution to delay and make the analysis harder. The RAT also checks for the presence of debuggers and uses pings make the threads sleep. Currently, most child processes and files dropped during the execution of the RAT have a low detection rate. When the malicious payload is delivered to the victim, commonly through a phishing mail or a Discord channel - the victim often receives a ZIP file containing a benign file in plain sight, and the heavily obfuscated batch file is hidden and automatically executed when launched. The bat file format is always very similar and looks like the contents of Figure 4, followed by base64 encoded text later in the file. Figure 4. Obfuscated bat script. During the bat execution, the script extracts two separate binaries from the base64 encoded text, AES decrypts, and GZIP decompresses it to produce two separate byte arrays. These byte arrays are then used with .NET reflection to perform an in-memory load of the assembly from its bytes, locate the binary’s entry point, and perform an Invoke on both. Throughout the decryption process, the attackers had the need to create a legitimate looking folder to drop an illicit version of the System Configuration Utility msconfig.exe that is required later. For this purpose, the script creates the folder “C:\Windows \System32\”, with a space after Windows and deletes it as soon as the utility is running. If it wasn’t for this file temporarily dropped into disk, the RAT would be fully fileless. The execution of one of the above-mentioned binaries leads to another obfuscated binary carrying an embedded resource. This resource is hidden behind anti-sandboxing and debugger techniques, only to lead to more obfuscation and encryption techniques that lead to the final payload. This payload has been built using the Github project Costura, which allows SeroXen to pack the code’s dependencies into the .NET assembly so it can run self-contained. Figure 5. Payload embedded resources. The extraction of the resources leads to the final payloads. This is in the form of two .NET assemblies: CSStub2.InstallStager.exe, and CSStub2.UninstallStager.exe. And a Win32 binary called CSStub2.$sxr-nircmd.exe, which corresponds to the unmodified command-line utility NirCmd. The payload InstallStager.exe is a compilation of the open-source rootkit named r77-rootkit – a fileless ring 3 rootkit written in .NET. This rootkit supports both x32 and x64 Windows processes and has the following features: R77 technical documentation provides a guideline of where can the prefix be found: Config parameter Details Example HIDE_PREFIX The prefix for name-based hiding (e.g. processes, files, etc...). L""$sxr"" R77_SERVICE_NAME32 Name for the scheduled task that starts the r77 service for 32-bit processes. HIDE_PREFIX L""svc32"" R77_SERVICE_NAME64 Name for the scheduled task that starts the r77 service for 64-bit processes. HIDE_PREFIX L""svc64"" CHILD_PROCESS_PIPE_NAME32 Name for the named pipe that notifies the 32-bit r77 service about new child processes. L""\\.\pipe\"" HIDE_PREFIX L""childproc32"" CHILD_PROCESS_PIPE_NAME64 Name for the named pipe that notifies the 64-bit r77 service about new child processes. L""\\.\pipe\"" HIDE_PREFIX L""childproc64"" CONTROL_PIPE_NAME Name for the named pipe that receives commands from external processes. L""\\.\pipe\"" HIDE_PREFIX L""control""   The two main components in this project are the InstallStager service and the Rootkit. The InstallStager service is responsible for: Figure 6. Starting payload after decryption using process hollowing. Now the second and main stage of the Rootkit is ready to start. The service kicks off the load of the rootkit’s DLL that is embedded as a resource and saves its configuration as a registry key. (In SeroXen case it's [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\$sxrconfig]). The service creates 3 listener threads: Figure 7. Child process injection. Command Details CONTROL_R77_UNINSTALL The control code that uninstalls r77. CONTROL_R77_PAUSE_INJECTION The control code that temporarily pauses injection of new processes. CONTROL_R77_RESUME_INJECTION The control code that resumes injection of new processes. CONTROL_PROCESSES_INJECT The control code that injects r77 into a specific process, if it is not yet injected. CONTROL_PROCESSES_INJECT_ALL The control code that injects r77 into all processes that are not yet injected. CONTROL_PROCESSES_DETACH The control code detaches r77 from a specific process. CONTROL_PROCESSES_DETACH_ALL The control code detaches r77 from all processes. CONTROL_USER_SHELLEXEC The control code that executes a file using ShellExecute. CONTROL_USER_RUNPE The control code that executes an executable using process hollowing. CONTROL_SYSTEM_BSOD The control code that triggers a BSOD. CONTROL_R77_TERMINATE_SERVICE The control code that terminates the r77 service.   The DLL rootkit carries out process injections, executes commands received by other processes, and keeps out of sight any sign of SeroXen being executed within the system. Figure 8. System function hooking. As a summary of the execution process: Figure 9. SeroXen decryption flow. Since Seroxen is based on QuasarRAT, the C&C server utilizes the same Common Name in their TLS certificate. The functionalities offered by the threat actor for the C&C server closely mirror those found in the Quasar Github repository, including support for TCP network streams (both IPv4 and IPv6), efficient network serialization, compression using QuickLZ, and secure communication through TLS encryption. Figure 10. Quasar Server Certificate.   The SeroXen developer has found a formidable combination of free resources to develop a hard to detect in static and dynamic analysis RAT. The use of an elaborated open-source RAT like Quasar, with almost a decade since its first appearance, makes an advantageous foundation for the RAT. While the combination of NirCMD and r77-rootkit are logical additions to the mix, since they make the tool more elusive and harder to detect. The Alien Labs team will continue to monitor the threat landscape for SeroXen samples and infrastructure. The following associated detection methods are in use by Alien Labs. They can be used by readers to tune or deploy detections in their own environments or for aiding additional research.

Posted December 27, 2022 By ThreatConnect The new year is almost upon us, and 2022 has been a game of ransomware hardball. However, lessons learned this year can help organizations take proactive steps to protect themselves from ransomware in 2023.  If you followed Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) alerts on ransomware for the year, you would have noted malicious activity attributed to many ransomware variants. CISA noted that threat actors’ ransomware tactics and techniques were continuing to evolve and become more technologically sophisticated with every passing month. That makes high-fidelity threat intelligence and a proactive security stance critically important to success in 2023. Many threat groups successfully leverage aging vulnerabilities, which, if they had been patched by their victims, may have prevented an attack. Organizations can have hundreds, thousands (or more) of un-remediated vulnerabilities that could open the door for an attacker. In a recent survey, respondents indicated that 57% of all observed vulnerabilities are more than two years old, with as many as 17% being more than five years old. For example, in December 2022, CISA issued an advisory on Cuba ransomware. One of the most common techniques used by Cuba actors exploited known vulnerabilities. In one featured example, Cuba actors exploited a vulnerability in the Windows Common Log File System (CLFS) that allowed them to steal system tokens and escalate privileges.  Cuba ransomware was first observed in 2019. In late 2021 and 2022, Cuba ransomware delivered an increasing number of high-profile attacks. By the end of 2022, Cuba ransomware threat actors had compromised over 100 organizations worldwide. Its demands for ransom have exceeded $145 million, with collections exceeding $60 million. While a top attack vector for Cuba is the exploitation of known vulnerabilities, the actors’ techniques also include phishing campaigns, compromised credentials, and remote desktop protocol exploits.  When it comes to Cuba and similar threats, access to high-fidelity threat intelligence to help identify the highest risk, most actively exploitable vulnerabilities can help prioritization efforts when organizations are faced with a backlog of vulnerabilities to address. Tools for phishing analysis and remediation that save security operations teams time and help find indicators of compromise across a sea of suspicious messages can also make a big difference in the fight against ransomware.  One initiative in the European Union has helped more than 1.5 million ransomware victims. These victims decrypted their files without accepting the ransom demands saving these individuals an estimated $1.5 billion. The program, No More Ransom, was conceived and supported by the National High Tech Crime Unit of the Netherlands’ police, Europol’s European Cybercrime Centre, Kaspersky, and McAfee and offers over 135 freely available decryption tools that can help with 165 variants of ransomware. No More Ransom now includes 185 partners from the public sector, private industry, law enforcement, and academia. The key to the success of an effort like No More Ransomware is information-sharing and collaboration. Combating malware, ransomware, and malicious cyber attacks has always relied on information sharing, exposure of actors’ TTPs and the dissemination of reliable threat intelligence so that security professionals can quickly develop mitigations, remediations, and update their defenses to block future attacks. The ThreatConnect Platform centralizes threat intelligence, improves decision-making, automates key activities, and enables information sharing and collaboration across the internal security organization and with external partners to help combat threats like ransomware in real-time. TI Ops teams, security operations, and everyone within the security organization will benefit when threat intelligence is aggregated, enriched, analyzed, and acted upon from a single source.  It’s well-known that ransomware can be delivered via un-remediated vulnerabilities, but many security teams are overwhelmed by the sheer number they are facing. Organizations can leverage threat intelligence in the ThreatConnect Platform to quickly prioritize and help drive vulnerability remediation.ThreatConnect collects real-time intelligence from the CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog and Google Project Zero, as well as other feeds and sources, enriching it with insights from sources such as the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) and the global ThreatConnect community. When combined with the data from your vulnerability scanners, it delivers a full picture of the exposures in your environment. Vulnerability Management teams are provided with vulnerabilities prioritized by those that are being actively exploited in order to take the right actions. Low-code automation of processes can make the required actions fast, reliable, and repeatable.  Another common delivery mechanism for ransomware attacks is via phishing emails, compounding the problem for security teams already overburdened with managing an ever-growing volume of suspicious messages that require review. ThreatConnect simplifies the processing, categorization, and response to suspicious emails, reducing the time to remediate active threats from days to minutes. The Platform can look for indicators across file attachments, embedded links, and more and provide in-platform risk scoring. Indicators can be enriched with data from third-party sources and CAL™ to identify and prioritize known malicious indicators. Once identified, indicators can be automatically sent to security tools, like secure email gateways and firewalls, to block threats in real-time.  To learn more about how ThreatConnect can help you prepare for the potential of a ransomware attack, check out the  ThreatConnect Platform.  Better yet, reach out to us, and we’ll be pleased to share a customized demonstration of the ThreatConnect Platform.

Kaspersky Lab has observed signs of attacks against government organizations and commercial entities in the US, Germany, South Korea and Uzbekistan. In 2014, targets included the White House and the US Department of State, as believed. The operation presents several interesting aspects The actor often spearphishes targets with e-mails containing a link to a hacked website. Sometimes it is a high profile, legitimate site such as “diplomacy.pl”, hosting a ZIP archive. The ZIP archive contains a RAR SFX which installs the malware and shows an empty PDF decoy. In other highly successful runs, this actor sends out phony flash videos directly as email attachments. A clever example is “Office Monkeys LOL Video.zip”. The executable within not only plays a flash video, but drops and runs another CozyDuke executable. These videos are quickly passed around offices with delight while systems are infected in the background silently. Many of this APT’s components are signed with phony Intel and AMD digital certificates. Recent CozyDuke APT activity attracted significant attention in the news: Sources: State Dept. hack the ‘worst ever’, CNN News, March 2015 White House computer network ‘hacked’, BBC News, October 2014 Three Months Later, State Department Hasn’t Rooted Out Hackers, Wall Street Journal, February 2015 State Department shuts down its e-mail system amid concerns about hacking, Washington Post, November 2014 Let’s examine a smattering of representative CozyDuke files and data. There is much to their toolset. CozyDuke droppers and spyware components often maintain fairly common characteristics, but these files’ functionality are modified in slight ways depending on the team’s needs. This rapid development and deployment is interesting. 68271df868f462c06e24a896a9494225,Office Monkeys LOL Video.zip Believe it or not, recipients in bulk run the file within: 95b3ec0a4e539efaa1faa3d4e25d51de,Office Monkeys (Short Flash Movie).exe This file in turn drops two executables to %temp%: It first launches Monkeys.exe, playing a self-contained, very funny video of white-collar tie wearing chimpanzees working in a high rise office with a human colleague. It then launches player.exe, a CozyDuke dropper maintaining anti-detection techniques: 3d3363598f87c78826c859077606e514,player.exe,338kb,Trojan.Win32.CozyBear.v,CompiledOn:2014.07.02 21:13:33 The file collects system information, and then invokes a WMI instance in the rootsecuritycenter namespace to identify security products installed on the system, meaning that this code was built for x86 systems, wql here: SELECT * FROM AntiVirusProduct SELECT * FROM FireWallProduct The code hunts for several security products to evade: In addition to the WMI/wql use, it also hunts through the “SOFTWAREMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionUninstall” registry key looking for security products to avoid. Following these checks, it drops several more malware files signed with the pasted AMD digital signature to a directory it creates. These files are stored within an 217kb encrypted cab file in the dropper’s resources under the name “A”. The cab file was encrypted and decrypted using a simple xor cipher with a rotating 16 byte key: x36x11xddx08xacx4bx72xf8x51x04x68x2ex3ex38x64x32. The cab file is decompressed and its contents are created on disk. These dropped files bundle functionality for both 64bit and 32bit Windows systems and are all located within one directory: C:Documents and SettingsuserApplication DataATI_Subsystem 6761106f816313394a653db5172dc487,amdhcp32.dll,54kb  ? 32bit dll,CompiledOn:2014.07.02 21:13:24 d596827d48a3ff836545b3a999f2c3e3,aticaldd.dll,60kb  ? 64bit dll,CompiledOn:2014.07.02 21:13:26 bc626c8f11ed753f33ad1c0fe848d898,atiumdag.dll,285kb ? 32bit dll, Trojan.Win32.CozyDuke.a, CompiledOn:2014.07.02 21:13:26 4152e79e3dbde55dcf3fc2014700a022,6kb,racss.dat The code copies rundll32.exe from windowssystem32 to its newly created %appdata%ATI_Subsystem subdirectory as “amdocl_as32.exe” alongside the three dll’s listed above. It runs atiumdag.dll with two parameter values, it’s only export and an arbitrary pid,  i.e.: “C:Documents and SettingsuserApplication DataATI_Subsystemamdocl_as32.exe” “C:Documents and SettingsuserApplication DataATI_Subsystematiumdag.dll””, ADL2_ApplicationProfiles_System_Reload 1684? This dll is built with anti-AV protections as well. However, it looks for a different but overlapping set, and the random duplication suggests that this component was cobbled together with its dropper, partly regionally based on target selection. The code collects information about the system and xml formats this data prior to encryption for proper parsing: Finally, this process beacons to www.sanjosemaristas.com, which appears to be a site that has been compromised and misused multiple times in the past couple of years. hxxp://www.sanjosemaristas[.]com/app/index.php?{A01BA0AD-9BB3-4F38-B76B-A00AD11CBAAA}, providing the current network adapter’s service name GUID. It uses standard Win32 base cryptography functions to generate a CALG_RC4 session key to encrypt the collected data communications and POSTs it to the server. Samples are usually signed with a fake certificate – we’ve seen two instances, one AMD and one Intel: Some of the malware uses an encrypted configuration file which is stored on disk as “racss.dat”. This is encrypted by RC4, using the key {0xb5, 0x78, 0x62, 0x52, 0x98, 0x3e, 0x24, 0xd7, 0x3b, 0xc6, 0xee, 0x7c, 0xb9, 0xed, 0x91, 0x62}. Here’s how it looks decrypted: The attackers send commands and new modules to be executed to the victims through the C&Cs. The C&C scripts store these temporarily until the victim next connects to retrieve local files. We’ve identified two such files: Here’s how such a database file appears: These are BASE64 encoded and use the same RC4 encryption key as the malware configuration. Decoding them resulted in the following payloads: 59704bc8bedef32709ab1128734aa846, ChromeUpdate.ex_ 5d8835982d8bfc8b047eb47322436c8a, cmd_task.dll e0b6f0d368c81a0fb197774d0072f759, screenshot_task.dll Decoding them also resulted in a set of tasking files maintaining agent commands and parameter values: conf.xml And a set of “reporting” files, maintaining stolen system “info”, error output, and “AgentInfo” output, from victim systems: DCOM_amdocl_ld_API_.raw Util_amdave_System_.vol Last_amdpcom_Subsystem_.max Data_amdmiracast_API_.aaf 7.txt screenshot_task.dll is a 32-bit dll used to take a screenshot of the full desktop window and save it as a bitmap in %temp%. The number of times the screenshot is repeated is configurable within the xml task file. cmd_task.dll is a 32-bit dll that maintains several primitives. It is used to create new processes, perform as a command line shell, and several other tasks. Each of these payloads is delivered together with a configuration file that explains how to run it, for instance: In another tasking, we notice a tracked victim: Attackers map a network drive use Microsoft OneDrive to run further tools: They copy down a base64 encoded document from Microsoft OneDrive to the victim system and decode it there: Not everything works as planned, so they maintain error reporting facility for the c2 communications: Furthermore, ChromeUpdate is a 64-bit executable (which appears to be a WEXTRACT package) that oddly drops a 32-bit Dll. Cache.dll is simply stored as a cabinet file in the ChromeUpdate’s resource section. ChromeUpdate.exe starts the file with “rundll32 cache.dll,ADB_Setup” Cache.dll was written in C/C++ and built with a Microsoft compiler. Cache.dll code flow overview Structurally, “Cache.dll” is a fairly large backdoor at 425KB. It maintains both code and data in the raw, encrypted blobs of data to be decrypted and used at runtime, and hidden functionality that isn’t exposed until runtime. No pdb/debug strings are present in the code. It maintains eight exports, including DllMain: ADB_Setup is a entry point that simply spawns another thread and waits for completion. Above, we see a new thread created with the start address of Cache.dll export  “ADB_Load” by the initial thread. This exported function is passed control while the initial thread runs a Windows message loop. It first grabs an encrypted blob stored away in a global variable and pulls out 381 bytes of this encrypted data: The standard win32 api CryptDecrypt uses rc4 to decrypt this blob into a hardcoded c2, url path, and url parameters listed below with a simple 140-bit key “x8BxFFx55x8BxECx83xECx50xA1x84x18x03x68x33xC9x66xF7x45x10xE8x1Fx89x45xFCx8Bx45x14x56”. The code then decodes this set of import symbols and resolves addresses for its networking and data stealing functionality: InternetCloseHandle InternetReadFile HttpSendRequestA HttpOpenRequestA HttpQueryInfoA InternetConnectA InternetCrackUrlA InternetOpenA InternetSetOptionW GetAdaptersInfo Much like the prior office monkey “atiumdag.dll” component, this code collects identifying system information using standard win32 API calls: It then uses the runtime resolved networking API calls to send the collected data back to a hardcoded c2 and set of urls. Cache.dll connectback urls: Observed user-agent string on the wire, but it’s dynamically generated based on the Windows system settings (retrieved using standard win32 api “ObtainUserAgentString”): “User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.04506.648; .NET CLR 3.5.21022)” Communications with the CozyDuke C2 include key/value pairs passed as URL parameters. Observed keys that remind us of the Cosmicduke communications include: One of the second stage modules of CozyDuke/Cozy Bear, Show.dll, is particularly interesting because it appears to have been built onto the same platform as OnionDuke. Below we compare Show.dll with the OnionDuke sample MD5: c8eb6040fd02d77660d19057a38ff769. Both have exactly the same export tables and appear to be called internally “UserCache.dll”: This seems to indicate the authors of OnionDuke and CozyDuke / Cozy Bear are the same, or working together. Another interesting comparison of two other files matches a recent second stage tool from the CozyDuke attacks with a second stage component from other Miniduke/Onionduke attacks. 2e0361fd73f60c76c69806205307ccac, update.dll (MiniDuke), 425kb (internal name = “UserCache.dll“) 9e3f3b5e9ece79102d257e8cf982e09e, cache.dll (CozyDuke), 425kb (internal name = “UserCache.dll“) The two share identical export function names in their export directories, and the naming appears to be randomly assigned at compile time. The table below presents the function matches based on size data, but the calls, jmps and code all match as well. The contents of only one of these exports in update.dll has no match whatsoever in cache.dll. Unlike the atiumdag.dll file above, however, cache.dll and update.dll do not maintain anti-AV and anti-analysis functionality sets. Perhaps they plan to pair this stealer with another dropper that maintains the WMI anti-AV functionality. This rotating functionality seems representational for the set, along with other characteristics. Their custom backdoor components appear to slightly evolve over time, with modifications to anti-detection, cryptography, and trojan functionality changing per operation. This rapid development and deployment reminds us of the APT28/Sofacy toolset, especially the coreshell and chopstick components. We expect ongoing and further activity from this group in the near future and variations on the malware used in previous duke-ish incidents.

Who is the target of this attack tool?,"On 24 February 2022, a multifaceted and deliberate cyber-attack against Viasat’s KA-SAT network resulted in a partial interruption of KA-SAT’s consumer-oriented satellite broadband service. While most users were unaffected by the incident, the cyber-attack did impact several thousand customers located in Ukraine and tens of thousands of other fixed broadband customers across Europe. This incident was localized to a single consumer-oriented partition of the KA-SAT network that is operated on Viasat’s behalf by a Eutelsat subsidiary, Skylogic, under a transition agreement Viasat signed with Eutelsat following Viasat’s purchase of Euro Broadband Infrastructure Sàrl (“EBI”), the wholesale broadband services business created as part of Viasat’s former partnering arrangement with Eutelsat. The residential broadband modems affected use the “Tooway” service brand. This cyber-attack did not impact Viasat’s directly managed mobility or government users on the KA-SAT satellite. Similarly, the cyber-attack did not affect users on other Viasat networks worldwide. Network stabilization and security mitigation actions began immediately, and the network was largely stabilized within hours and fully stabilized within several days. Viasat also undertook proactive operational measures to ensure other essential back-office applications and reporting/analytics services were not impacted. These actions were strictly precautionary while Viasat monitored network behavior and activity. Viasat, alongside the third-party incident response and forensics leader Mandiant, are continuing to work with Eutelsat/Skylogic, as well as law enforcement and U.S. and international government agencies to investigate the cyber-attack. That investigation is still ongoing. We believe the purpose of the attack was to interrupt service. There is no evidence that any end-user data was accessed or compromised, nor customer personal equipment (PCs, mobile devices, etc.) was improperly accessed, nor is there any evidence that the KA-SAT satellite itself or its supporting satellite ground infrastructure itself were directly involved, impaired or compromised. Viasat is working closely with the wholesale distributors to bring their customers back online. Because of the wholesale nature of the business, Viasat does not typically transact directly with end-users – instead the distributors work directly with end-customers and can identify those affected to provide support for restoring service. Certain end-customer modems promptly received over-the-air updates, but where such updates are insufficient to timely restore functionality, new modems are being provided as the most efficient way to restore service. Viasat has already shipped tens of thousands of replacement modems to distributors and is ready to ship additional modems as needed. Incident Summary At approximately 0302 UTC on 24 February 2022, high volumes of focused, malicious traffic were detected emanating from several SurfBeam2 and SurfBeam 2+ modems and/or associated customer premise equipment (CPE) physically located within Ukraine and serviced by one of the KA-SAT consumer-oriented network partitions. This targeted denial of service attack made it difficult for many modems to remain online. As Viasat personnel engaged with Skylogic personnel to triage the situation, and worked to force the malicious modems offline, other modems emerged on the network to continue the targeted traffic-based attack throughout the next several hours, degrading the ability of legitimate modems to enter or otherwise remain active on the network. Around the same time, Viasat and Skylogic began to observe a gradual decline in the number of modems online in the same commercial-oriented partition. This gradual decline of connected modems continued until approximately 0415 UTC, when Viasat and Skylogic observed larger numbers of modems across much of Europe exiting the network over the course of about 45 minutes. All of these modems are serviced by the same consumer-oriented service partition. Ultimately, tens of thousands of modems that were previously online and active dropped off the network, and these modems were not observed attempting to re-enter the network. The attack impacted a majority of the previously active modems within Ukraine, and a substantial number of additional modems in other parts of Europe. Subsequent investigation and forensic analysis identified a ground-based network intrusion by an attacker exploiting a misconfiguration in a VPN appliance to gain remote access to the trusted management segment of the KA-SAT network. The attacker moved laterally through this trusted management network to a specific network segment used to manage and operate the network, and then used this network access to execute legitimate, targeted management commands on a large number of residential modems simultaneously. Specifically, these destructive commands overwrote key data in flash memory on the modems, rendering the modems unable to access the network, but not permanently unusable. Viasat has conducted an exhaustive analysis of impacted modems and confirmed no anomalies or impacts to any electrical components, no impact or compromise of any modem physical or electronic components, no evidence of any compromise or tampering with Viasat modem software or firmware images and no evidence of any supply-chain interference. The modems can be fully restored via a factory reset. To date, Viasat has no evidence that standard modem software or firmware distribution or update processes involved in normal network operations were used or compromised in the attack. Mitigation and Restoration Viasat worked with Skylogic to implement several mitigation and recovery actions to restore network stability, preserve continuing service for unaffected end-customers and mitigate or prevent similar attacks. Viasat is leveraging the lessons learned from this incident to further enhance the security features of its products. As this is an ongoing investigation, and to preserve Viasat’s and Skylogic’s ability to safely and securely provide service on the KA-SAT network, specific technical details on those mitigation actions will not be shared publicly at this time. Throughout the course of the investigation, Viasat continued to provide broadband services to unaffected end-customers, as well as mobility and Viasat government customers who were unaffected by this attack. Since the attack, Viasat has worked with its distributors to restore service to all customers whose modems were rendered inoperable. Viasat has already shipped nearly 30,000 modems to distributors to bring customers back online. Viasat continues to provide immediately functional modems to distributors who request them so they can support expedited service restoration and impact mitigation for affected end-customers. Viasat, Mandiant and Skylogic are continuing to cooperate with various law enforcement and government agencies around the world. Background: KA-SAT network and transition agreement between Viasat and Eutelsat Eutelsat launched commercial broadband service from the KA-SAT satellite on 31 May 2011. In April 2021, Viasat completed the purchase of EBI, the wholesale broadband services business created as part of Viasat’s former partnering arrangement with Eutelsat as well as the KA-SAT satellite asset and corresponding ground infrastructure. Skylogic, a subsidiary of Eutelsat, continues to operate and support the ground segment operations of the KA-SAT network on Viasat’s behalf, an arrangement that was originally expected to end sometime later this year. Currently, Viasat is the wholesale provider of satellite broadband services to end-customers served by the KA-SAT network, and its independent network of distributors market and sell these services to primarily residential customers.

Who is the target of this attack pattern?,"Adversaries may communicate using OSI application layer protocols to avoid detection/network filtering by blending in with existing traffic. Commands to the remote system, and often the results of those commands, will be embedded within the protocol traffic between the client and server. Adversaries may utilize many different protocols, including those used for web browsing, transferring files, electronic mail, or DNS. For connections that occur internally within an enclave (such as those between a proxy or pivot node and other nodes), commonly used protocols are SMB, SSH, or RDP.[1] Clambling has the ability to use Telnet for communication.[2] Duqu uses a custom command and control protocol that communicates over commonly used ports, and is frequently encapsulated by application layer protocols.[3] Hildegard has used an IRC channel for C2 communications.[4] Lucifer can use the Stratum protocol on port 10001 for communication between the cryptojacking bot and the mining server.[5] Magic Hound malware has used IRC for C2.[6][7] Adversaries can also use NETEAGLE to establish an RDP connection with a controller over TCP/7519. QUIETEXIT can use an inverse negotiated SSH connection as part of its C2.[1] Rocke issued wget requests from infected systems to the C2.[8] Siloscape connects to an IRC server for C2.[9] TeamTNT has used an IRC bot for C2 communications.[10] Use network appliances to filter ingress or egress traffic and perform protocol-based filtering.

What is the name of the new ransomware family that has emerged?,"A new ransomware family calling itself 3AM has emerged. To date, the ransomware has only been used in a limited fashion. Symantec’s Threat Hunter Team, part of Broadcom, has seen it used in a single attack by a ransomware affiliate that attempted to deploy LockBit on a target’s network and then switched to 3AM when LockBit was blocked. 3AM is written in Rust and appears to be a completely new malware family. The ransomware attempts to stop multiple services on the infected computer before it begins encrypting files. Once encryption is complete, it attempts to delete Volume Shadow (VSS) copies. It is still unclear whether its authors have any links to known cybercrime organizations.  The first suspicious activity from the threat actor involved the use of the gpresult command to dump the policy settings enforced on the computer for a specified user. The attacker also executed various Cobalt Strike components and tried to escalate privileges on the computer using PsExec. The attackers then ran reconnaissance commands such as whoami, netstat, quser, and net share, and tried to enumerate other servers for lateral movement with the quser and net view commands. They also added a new user for persistence and used the Wput tool to exfiltrate the victims’ files to their own FTP server. The attackers first attempted to use the LockBit ransomware but when that was blocked, they resorted to 3AM instead. The use of 3AM was only partially successful. The attackers only managed to deploy it to three machines on the organization's network and it was blocked on two of those three computers. 3AM is so-called because it appends encrypted files with the extension .threeamtime. The ransom note also makes reference to 3AM: Hello. ""3 am"" The time of mysticism, isn't it? All your files are mysteriously encrypted, and the systems ""show no signs of life"", the backups disappeared. But we can correct this very quickly and return all your files and operation of the systems to original state. All your attempts to restore data by himself will definitely lead to their damage and the impossibility of recovery. We are not recommended to you to do it on our own!!! (or do at your own peril and risk). There is another important point: we stole a fairly large amount of sensitive data from your local network: financial documents; personal information of your employees, customers, partners; work documentation, postal correspondence and much more. We prefer to keep it secret, we have no goal to destroy your business. Therefore can be no leakage on our part. We propose to reach an agreement and conclude a deal. Otherwise, your data will be sold to DarkNet/DarkWeb. One can only guess how they will be used. Please contact us as soon as possible, using Tor-browser: http://threeam7[REDACTED].onion/recovery  Access key: [32 CHARS SPECIFIED BY -k COMMAND LINE PARAMETER] The ransomware is a 64-bit executable written in Rust and it recognises the following command-line parameters: The command-line parameters ""-m"" and ""-h"" are mutually exclusive. The usage of the “-h” and “-m” parameters and its values “local” and “net” are very similar to arguments used by Conti.

The malware will then create the file ""RECOVER-FILES.txt"" in each scanned folder. This file contains the ransom note. The encrypted files contain a marker string ""0x666"" followed by the data appended by the ransomware. After encryption, the malware attempts to run the following command to delete volume shadow backup copies: vssadmin.exe delete shadows /all /quiet Ransomware affiliates have become increasingly independent from ransomware operators and this is not the first time Symantec has seen an attacker attempt to deploy two different kinds of ransomware in a single attack.  New ransomware families appear frequently and most disappear just as quickly or never manage to gain significant traction. However, the fact that 3AM was used as a fallback by a LockBit affiliate suggests that it may be of interest to attackers and could be seen again in the future.  For the latest protection updates, please visit the Symantec Protection Bulletin.

Who have used this malware in the past?,"Cybersecurity News, Threat Research, and more from the Team Spearheading the Evolution of Endpoint Security The Aurora stealer is a notorious Golang-based information stealer that's been gaining popularity from the end of 2022 through the first quarter of 2023. The Morphisec Threat Labs team has been tracing its activities using our prevention telemetry along with dark-web activities.   In this blog post however, we aren’t going to cover Aurora, but a sometimes overlooked, extremely critical component of the attack delivery chain. The component that makes Aurora’s delivery stealthy and dangerous is a highly evasive loader we named “in2al5d p3in4er.”   The in2al5d p3in4er loader is compiled with Embarcadero RAD Studio and targets endpoint workstations using advanced anti-VM (virtual machine) technique we describe in detail in this post.   We also cover new techniques with significant negative outcomes that represent a concerning change in the landscape, especially in the new era of ChatGPT.  Threat actors always find innovative ways to spread malware and access sensitive information. One growing trend is using YouTube as a malware distribution channel. Hackers take over popular YouTube accounts and post videos with links to malicious websites or downloads. To increase video visibility, they use search engine optimization (SEO) tags to make a video rank higher in search results.   Stealing YouTube accounts is a lucrative business for cybercriminals. Many underground forums and marketplaces offer these services for a fee. The threat actor in this post appears to be using this method as a service, including the websites the videos redirect to.  Compromised YouTube channel The service uses artificial intelligence (AI) to generate videos. This streamlines the process of creating convincing budget backed content. And it allows threat actors to automate diverse lure creation, such as fake software that tricks users into clicking on links.  Example video with download instructions  The above video redirects to different websites that look legitimate.  Fake websites redirected by the YouTube video  The service the threat actors are using enables the creation of decoy websites that look identical to the original websites. These fake websites use similar URLs, logos, and branding to convincingly appear legitimate. Once a user visits one of these sites, they’re enticed to download an application containing malware or lured to enter sensitive/personal information into the decoy generated website. These websites use geographical targeting to deliver content based on the visitor’s geo-location. The website below is a clone of jobseeker.com  Decoy website for jobseeker.com  This loader uses a surprisingly simple yet highly effective evasion technique. It leverages the usage of CreateDXGIFactory function of dxgi.dll library to query the vendor ID of the graphics card installed on a system. The ID is then compared against a whitelist of vendor IDs; specifically, the 0x10de (NVIDIA), 0x1002 (AMD), and 0x8086 (Intel) graphics cards. If the vendor ID doesn’t match the whitelisted values, the loader makes it appear as a benign application by terminating itself.  The anti-VM function checks the graphics vendor ID  After checking the vendor IDs, the loader decrypts the final payload in separate chunks and injects it into `sihost.exe` using a process hollowing technique.   Payload decryption routine  Some samples of the loader do not use the process hollowing technique. Instead, they allocate memory to write the decrypted payload into the allocated memory, and then make a call to the payload entry point (EP).  Payload injection  During the injection process, all loader samples resolve the necessary Win APIs dynamically and decrypt these names using a XOR key: ""in2al5d p3in4er"" (invalid printer), as illustrated in the figure below.   String decryption routine using the ""invalid printer"" key  Another element helping the low detection rate on VirusTotal is the threat actor using Embarcadero RAD Studio to generate executables. Embarcadero RAD Studio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for building software applications that runs on various platforms and operating systems.  Examining samples from our investigation, we found the threat actor is compiling executables using several options from the Embarcadero IDE. Those with the lowest detection rate on VirusTotal are compiled using “BCC64.exe”, a new Clang based C++ compiler from Embarcadero. This compiler is based on a different code base than a “Standard Library” (Dinkumware) or “Runtime Library” (compiler-rt) and generates optimized code which changes the entry point and execution flow. This breaks security vendors’ indicators, such as signatures composed from “malicious/suspicious code block.”  A zero detection rate on VirusTotal  The loader is particularly successful in evading sandboxes and virtual machines. As seen in the image below, the loader has evaded execution by multiple sandboxes. This is a testament to the effectiveness of the loader's simplicity, which leverages a specific aspect of system configuration to achieve exceptional stealth.  Example of sandboxes that fail to execute   Note: A similar technique for evading virtual machines was covered in 2016. It checked the graphics’ card vendor ID using the DXGI.dll. Although the anti-VM techniques observed in the wild are generally based on blacklisting, this approach uses an inverse check which only searches for graphic cards the target victim should own. This helps to evade sandbox analysis that searches for blacklists of graphic cards.  Malware loaders like in2al5d p3in4er are essentially basic delivery. They establish a foothold between an attacker and their compromised target and are typically the first stage of an attack.   The attackers behind in2al5d p3in4er are combining it with widely accessible social engineering tools for a high impact campaign that takes over popular YouTube accounts and directs viewers to convincing looking fake websites. They’re then enticed to download malware from a fake website.  One of the first steps to avoid compromise by in2al5d p3in4er is training organization employees how to detect social engineering campaigns: ensuring URLs are legitimate, and not downloading cracked versions of software.  But as the detection ratio of zero on VirusTotal makes clear, reactive, detection-based cybersecurity technologies like those used in NGAV, EPP, and EDR/XDR are barely capable of detecting and stopping in2al5d p3in4er. Stopping this loader requires different technology.   Morphisec’s Automated Moving Target Defense (AMTD) technology takes a fundamentally different approach to cybersecurity that isn’t detection-based. Instead of waiting for malware to breach a system before detecting it, Morphisec proactively secures runtime memory to prevent any unauthorized code—like in2al5d p3in4er—from executing, regardless of whether a recognizable signature or behavior pattern exists for it.

These operations are very likely aimed at stealing information and gaining persistent remote access."
Who controls the threat actor?,"Welcome to this week’s edition of the Threat Source newsletter. Last week, the Biden administration released its formal roadmap for its national cybersecurity initiative meant to encourage greater investment in cybersecurity and strengthen the U.S.’s critical infrastructure security (and more). The roadmap goes a long way toward actualizing a plan the administration released earlier this year and sets tangible goals and programs to put many of these initiatives into action. But because nothing ever moves quickly in government, this roadmap and the associated plan are already hitting a few roadblocks. First, there’s the ever-present partisan politics. Republican state lawmakers are backing a legal challenge in the court systems to block an Environmental Protection Administration rule that asked local water systems to evaluate their current cybersecurity systems and protections while conducting sanitation surveys. To me, simply asking critical infrastructure to consider these factors as part of their normal processes seems like a non-issue, but the U.S. Appeals Court has put a hold on this rule for the time being (though it didn’t give a precise reason at the time of its ruling). If lawmakers are going to hash these types of regulations in court every time something new pops up, we’ll never reach the point of these rules actually being implemented. Two leading Republican members of the U.S. House came out hours after the Biden administration released the roadmap, saying they would use their respective House panels to, “exercise strict oversight on CISA’s efforts” to implement many of the policies outlined. Regardless of which side of the political spectrum you fall, cybersecurity should be something our lawmakers can all agree on. Say these arguments extend through the 2024 election — what happens if control of the White House or Congress switches between parties? And then that changes again in 2026? Change is slow, so none of these initiatives are going to be implemented overnight. If our government can’t come to any sort of agreement about the importance of cybersecurity, and how to encourage stronger public-private partnerships to reach the country’s goals, this is just going to be another partisan issue that’s held up by legal challenges, budget negotiations, hearings and verbal discourse. And by the time that all subsides, the people in charge of outlining and implementing these cybersecurity goals could have very well changed. So, forgive me if I’m coming off as a bit skeptical that anything in this roadmap will end up passing any mile markers. Our researchers recently discovered a threat actor conducting several campaigns against government entities, military organizations and civilian users in Ukraine and Poland. Our recent reporting states that these operations are very likely aimed at stealing information and gaining persistent remote access. The activity we analyzed occurred as early as April 2022 and as recently as earlier this month, demonstrating the persistent nature of the threat actor. The final payloads include the AgentTesla remote access trojan (RAT), Cobalt Strike beacons and njRAT. If you’re a user in Ukraine or Poland, especially someone working in the government or military sectors, this is a clear-cut example of a spam campaign targeting this population. For those who fall outside of that demographic, it’s interesting that this group is still relying on the user enabling macros in Office, since Microsoft disabled those by default earlier this year. These are also highly targeted emails with (relatively speaking) convincing lures, so whoever is behind these is not to be ignored. There are multiple Cisco Secure protections in place to defend against the types of spam used in these campaigns. Other Snort rules and detection content can prevent the execution of the malware used as the final payload. Our researchers have also published examples of the types of lure images and documents used in the initial phishing emails so users can know what to be on the lookout for. Chinese state-sponsored actors reportedly accessed email accounts belonging to several U.S.-based organizations and federal government agencies, including the State Department. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) released a detailed timeline on the campaign, stating that an investigation from Microsoft revealed that “advanced persistent threat (APT) actors accessed and exfiltrated unclassified Exchange Online Outlook data” after users reported suspicious activities in their Microsoft 365 cloud environment. While the full scope of the hack is still under investigation, reports indicate that the actors were primarily trying to steal sensitive information. While CISA or Microsoft have yet to disclose any specific vulnerabilities the actors exploited, the CISA report does say that the APT used a Microsoft account consumer key to forge tokens and impersonate targeted users. “Microsoft remediated the issue by first blocking tokens issued with the acquired key and then replacing the key to prevent continued misuse,” the report states. (CISA, CNN) Popular tax preparation software companies are under fire from lawmakers for allegedly sharing personal information with social media sites, including Google and Meta. Several Democratic lawmakers released a report last week that accused TaxAct, H&R Block and TaxSlayer of embedding Meta and Google’s tracking pixels on their sites, potentially violating U.S. law and sharing taxpayers’ information with those companies. The report says the data was kept anonymous, but the companies could “easily” use the information to identify individuals or create targeted advertising for them. The report has also renewed calls for the Internal Revenue Service to offer its own, free online tax filing service for U.S. consumers. (Vox, USA Today) Apple had to roll back and then re-release a security update that addressed an actively exploited vulnerability in WebKit. Apple initially released a Rapid Security Response patch for iPhones and iPads on July 11 to fix CVE-2023-37450, a remote code execution vulnerability in the WebKit browser engine that Safari and other web browsers use. However, users reported that the fix was causing Safari to not connect correctly to major websites like Facebook, Instagram and Zoom, leading Apple to pull back the patch. Since then, Apple released a new fix for iOS, iPadOS and macOS that reliably fixes the vulnerability again. Though few details are currently available about CVE-2023-37450, Apple indicated it had been exploited in the wild and could be triggered by a vulnerable browser processing specially crafted web content. (Forbes, Gizmodo) BlackHat (Aug. 5 - 10) Las Vegas, Nevada Grace Hopper Celebration (Sept. 26 - 29) Orlando, Florida “Most prevalent malware files” is taking a break this week for maintenance.

How does the CSP rule system contribute to data exfiltration?,"Connect with a HUMAN bot protection expert to find out how our products can help you meet your project deadline and security needs HUMAN Insight and Research from our team CSP can define a list of domains that the browser should be allowed to interact with for the visited URL. Designed to guard against XSS attacks, CSP helps control which domains can be accessed as part of a page and therefore restricts which domains to share data with. It even can restrict forms to be sent only to specific hosts, using the form-action directive. These restrictions are specified by a list of allowed URIs. Unfortunately, the path matching algorithm used ignores query strings. As is often the case, an embedded third-party service that identifies its user’s account using a query string can’t be restricted to a given account. By analyzing field data we see a gap in the implementation of CSP, and even for sites that do use it correctly, this creates an open window to exfiltrate data. Our demonstration shows how using the Google Analytics API, a web skimmer can send data to be collected in his own account instance. As Google Analytics is allowed in the CSP configuration of many major sites, this demo shows how an attacker can bypass this security protection and steal data. Our gathered field data shows the following statistics on CSP usage across the Internet (based on HTTPArchive March 2020 scan): Looking at the top 3M domains, only 210K use CSP. Out of these: Most don’t even do much besides Since the most common allowed domain is google-analytics.com (17K websites) it was the natural candidate to test our theory. So let’s dive in and see what can be done with that. In our demonstration, using a simple mechanism, we can leak data over commonly allowed third-party domains. We took google-analytics as an example, but other services can also be used. As an example, we took the twitter login page, which implemented the following CSP rule (which contains https://www.google-analytics.com): The following short JS code inserted into the site will send the credentials to google-analytics console controlled by us: The UA-#######-# parameter is the tag ID owner that Google Analytics uses to connect the data to a specific account. Instead of using twitter’s google-analytic account, we used an account we control. Unfortunately, the CSP policy can’t discriminate based on the Tag ID. This will allow the dp parameter to be sent to our account. Though Google meant to have this parameter be used to mention the page the user visited, we used it to exfiltrate the user name and password data encoded in base64. In our Google Analytics platform, we will see the data as: In our demo the DP will result in page view of bmV3ZW1haWxAcGVyaW1ldGVyeC5jb206bmV3cGFzcw== Which will be decoded from base64 as: ""newemail@perimeterx.com:newpass"" The source of the problem is that the CSP rule system isn’t granular enough. Recognizing and stopping the above malicious JavaScript request requires advanced visibility solutions that can detect the access and exfiltration of sensitive user data (in this case the user’s email address and password). One might think we could have updated the CSP to only allow specific TIDs: 'connect-src https://www.google-analytics.com/r/collect?*tid=[SPECIFIC_ACCOUNT]'. The problem is that CSP doesn't support query strings (See Spec): Note: Query strings have no impact on matching: the source expression example.com/file matches all of https://example.com/file, https://example.com/file?key=value, https://example.com/file?key=notvalue, and https://example.com/file?notkey=notvalue. Having such a gap with the most commonly used domain allowed with CSP is a major risk indicator of the threats that can come from other domains that are used to serve multiple accounts. A possible solution would come from adaptive URLs, adding the ID as part of the URL or subdomain to allow admins to set CSP rules that restrict data exfiltration to other accounts. A more granular future direction for strengthening CSP direction to consider as part of the CSP standard is XHR proxy enforcement. This will essentially create a client-side WAF that can enforce a policy on where specific data field are allowed to be transmitted. While CSP is a useful tool to have in your web security tool belt, it is not foolproof. In addition to the complexity of managing CSP rules, this vulnerability shows how widely used services such as Google Analytics can be subverted to bypass this protection.","The CSP rule system isn’t granular enough and ignores query strings. This allows data to be exfiltrated over commonly allowed third-party domains, such as Google Analytics. An attacker can bypass this security protection and steal data by sending it to their own account instance."
What are the capabilities of NetworkMiner?,"NetworkMiner is an open source network forensics tool that extracts artifacts, such as files, images, emails and passwords, from captured network traffic in PCAP files. NetworkMiner can also be used to capture live network traffic by sniffing a network interface. Detailed information about each IP address in the analyzed network traffic is aggregated to a network host inventory, which can be used for passive asset discovery as well as to get an overview of which devices that are communicating. NetworkMiner is primarily designed to run in Windows, but can also be used in Linux. NetworkMiner has, since the first release in 2007, become a popular tool among incident response teams as well as law enforcement. NetworkMiner is today used by companies and organizations all over the world. Host inventory in NetworkMiner NetworkMiner can extract files, emails and certificates transferred over the network by parsing a PCAP file or by sniffing traffic directly from the network. NetworkMiner showing files extracted from sniffed network traffic to disk NetworkMiner showing thumbnails for images extracted to disk User credentials (usernames and passwords) for supported protocols are extracted by NetworkMiner and displayed under the ""Credentials"" tab. The credentials tab sometimes also shows information that can be used to identify a particular person, such as user accounts for popular online services like Gmail or Facebook. Another very useful feature is that the user can search sniffed or stored data for keywords. NetworkMiner allows the user to insert arbitrary string or byte-patterns that shall be searched for with the keyword search functionality. NetworkMiner Professional can be delivered either as an Electronic Software Download (ESD) or shipped physically on a USB flash drive. The product is exactly the same, regardless of delivery method. NetworkMiner is a portable application that doesn't require any installation, which means that the USB version can be run directly from the USB flash drive. However, we recommend that you copy NetworkMiner to the local hard drive of your computer in order to achieve maximum performance. » How To Buy NetworkMiner Professional « The latest version of NetworkMiner can be downloaded from: » https://www.netresec.com/?download=NetworkMiner « (executable application)    SHA256 hash: c610f6ba647ddd9c718e87018ee40595a4d72a52a6b3b7ceb53caf4fa8de6f05 (hash link) » https://www.netresec.com/?page=NetworkMinerSourceCode « (source code)    SHA256 hash: bea2a03eed8cd2fe605e9fb446f381bd408a09a8f4ffcb678ac474f62e72dff0 (hash link) For older releases of NetworkMiner (prior to version 2.0), please visit the NetworkMiner page on SourceForge:https://sourceforge.net/projects/networkminer/files/networkminer/ However, please note that we no longer release new versions of NetworkMiner on SourceForge. Q: How do I run NetworkMiner in Linux? Install Mono (cross platform, open source .NET framework), download and extract NetworkMiner and then start NetworkMiner with mono NetworkMiner.exe. For more details, please see our HowTo install NetworkMiner in Ubuntu Fedora and Arch Linux blog post. Q: Can I run NetworkMiner on a Mac? The support for Mono on macOS is very limited, but you can try the following solution: Install Mono with ""brew install mono"", download and extract NetworkMiner and then start NetworkMiner with ""mono --arch=32 NetworkMiner.exe"". For more details, please see our Running NetworkMiner on Mac OS X blog post. Q: How do I sniff network traffic with NetworkMiner in Windows? To sniff with raw sockets you'll first need to create a firewall rule to allow NetworkMiner to capture incoming TCP packets. Run the command ""wf.msc"" to start Windows Defender Firewall and create a new inbound rule for NetworkMiner.exe. Next, start NetworkMiner as administrator and select a network interface in the drop down list at the top of the GUI. Finally, start a live packet capture by clicking the Start button. Q: Can NetworkMiner sniff network traffic in Linux? NetworkMiner only supports live sniffing through PCAP-over-IP when Mono is used. Q: Can NetworkMiner extract files from HTTPS traffic? NetworkMiner is not designed to perform decryption, so files transferred inside TLS encrypted sessions, like HTTPS, will not be extracted. X.509 certificates from TLS handshakes will be extracted to disk by NetworkMiner though. You can use a TLS proxy, like PolarProxy, in order to decrypt TLS traffic and forward decrypted traffic to NetworkMiner. See our video PolarProxy in Windows Sandbox for more details.

Who controls the infrastructure?,"There is no formal definition of what constitutes a ‘complex attack’. Terrorist attacks exhibit varying degrees of complexity – from high to low – depending on a number of characteristics. Characteristics of the most complex terrorist attacks include the use of well-prepared, well-trained and well-armed attackers, adopting military-style tactics, as well as striking multiple targets in a co-ordinated way.   Attacks of high complexity in the UK are rare. The most complex, completed attack in recent years was in 2017 when a suicide attacker detonated an IED at the Manchester Arena, killing 22 and injuring a further 116. High complexity terrorist attacks in the West have been committed by those following an Islamist extremist ideology and have been directed or enabled by terrorist groups overseas. More complex attacks can also be carried out by Self-Initiated Terrorists (S-ITs) inspired by an ideology.   There is no formal or universally agreed definition of what constitutes a ‘complex attack’. It can be argued that all terrorist attacks exhibit varying degrees of complexity. Low complexity attacks are considered those typically carried out by a lone attacker, employing a simple methodology against a single target. Conversely, attacks of higher complexity are acts of terrorism that exhibit particular characteristics, which can include one or more of the following: multiple targets are struck by multiple attackers either simultaneously or in close succession employs well-armed and well-trained individuals employing military or law enforcement style tactics timings and methods are coordinated with other attackers and those providing assistance to the attackers attackers strike quickly and move to another location before law enforcement can interdict and disrupt access to victims and first responders is delayed or denied by use of diversions, obstructions or booby-traps to delay law enforcement response secondary attacks are conducted on first responders, evacuation routes, and/or sites that are part of the response significant levels of planning and preparation such as researching methodologies and targets, training, establishment of covert facilities and hostile reconnaissance Because of these factors, it is difficult to describe an attack as simply ‘complex’ or ‘not complex’. Therefore, it is more accurate to ascribe a level of complexity for an attack such as high, medium or low. The following graphic shows examples of attacks assessed for their relative levels of complexity.     The attacks in Streatham (2020) and London Bridge (2017) are considered low-complexity due to the fact that in each case only one attack cell was involved, targeting a single venue and using a simple methodology. At the other end of the scale is the marauding attack in Paris and the 7/7 London bombings, both of which involved groups of well-prepared and trained operatives attacking multiple targets in a co-ordinated way. Examples of medium-complexity attacks, lying between the two extremes, are the attacks in London in 2017 and Christchurch in 2019. Although both of these involved only single attackers, there was likely a greater degree of planning and preparation required.   Complexity should not be confused with the level of sophistication associated with a particular methodology. Where complexity refers to how the attack is conducted, sophistication describes the attack methodology used. A sophisticated methodology, such as a home-made explosive, could be used in a low complexity attack, and vice versa. Sophisticated methodologies require greater levels of preparation, knowledge and skill.   A marauding terrorist attack (MTA) shares many of the characteristics of a complex terrorist attack. MTAs are fast-moving, violent attacks where assailants move through a location aiming to find and kill or injure as many people as possible. However, depending on the number of attackers and the methodology used, not every MTA will be complex. For example an attack involving a single marauding attacker using a knife would not be classified as complex.   Attacks of high complexity in the UK are rare. The most complex successful attack in recent years was in 2017 when a suicide attacker detonated an IED at the Manchester Arena, killing 22 and injuring a further 116. However, it has become clear that Salman did not act alone. On 20th August 2020 the attacker's brother was sentenced to 55 years imprisonment for his part in planning the attack, having been found guilty of 22 counts of murder. Over the last twenty years complex terrorist attacks in the West have been committed by those following an Islamist extremist ideology and have been directed or enabled by terrorist groups overseas. However, more complex attacks can also be carried out by self-initiated terrorists (S-ITs) inspired by an ideology.   By their very nature, higher complexity attacks will almost certainly have a greater impact on business and the public than other types of attacks, given that attackers nearly always target civilians at multiple locations as they move through busy city centres. This impact can be compounded by the difficulties of planning for and implementing an effective multi-disciplinary response, at the required scale and at multiple locations. Nevertheless, as with all types of terrorist attacks, the public and business community have a vital role in alerting the authorities to suspicious activity that may be the prelude to a terrorist attack.   When describing threats in intelligence assessments, Counter Terrorism Policing utilises the Probabilistic Yardstick. The Probabilistic Yardstick is a tool created by the Professional Head of Intelligence Analysis (PHIA), in the UK government, to standardise the way in which we describe probability in intelligence assessments. For example, if we use the term ‘likely’ what we mean is ‘a 55-75% chance’. Use the scale below as a reference when reading ProtectUK Insights.    ","The infrastructure in the context of complex terrorist attacks is controlled by well-prepared, well-trained, and well-armed attackers. These attackers adopt military-style tactics and strike multiple targets in a coordinated way. The most complex attacks are directed or enabled by terrorist groups overseas. However, more complex attacks can also be carried out by Self-Initiated Terrorists (S-ITs) inspired by an ideology."
Who controls X?,"Support for five leading EDR solutions, including our own bundled Taegis™ agent with 100% visibility, means that Secureworks approach to open XDR provides superior protection and greater value. A technical evaluation of the EDR vendor landscape by MITRE Engenuity ATT&CK® Evaluations affirms that Secureworks industry-leading Taegis XDR platform offers superior value for cybersecurity leaders. In particular, Taegis XDR helps security leaders mitigate their risk within the constraints of limited budgets and staffing. In the first MITRE evaluation to include Taegis, the Secureworks EDR agent achieved 100% visibility and 95% detection across the 19 steps of the evaluation. That firmly puts Secureworks Taegis ahead of many well-known, established vendors. In addition, the Taegis Linux agent had analytic detections across 100% of the steps in which it was used, providing robust detection for cloud workloads. Secureworks is the only evaluated vendor that fully ingests, at a deep level, telemetry from five of the leading EDR agents, including CrowdStrike, Microsoft, SentinelOne, Carbon Black, and the versatile Taegis agent. With Secureworks open-without-compromise approach, customers have the choice to leverage endpoint telemetry from a diverse grouping of agents as part of their broader approach to threat detection and response. Additionally, Secureworks doesn’t just integrate with these agents and other telemetry sources. We add our own layer of detection and threat intelligence to prioritize the threats presenting the highest risk to our customers, filling the gap where others have missed detections. Taegis XDR’s out-of-the-box integrations with these diverse endpoint agents is especially important given that 1) more than 30% of organizations have deployed EDR from more than one vendor, according to Secureworks analysis and 2) security teams must be prepared to diligently protect their organizations even if M&A activity introduces new endpoint agents into their enterprise environments. Secureworks customers can also use the included native endpoint agent provided with the Taegis XDR platform to cover their enterprise environment without additional cost. The Taegis agent, tested as part of the MITRE evaluation for the first time, provides 100% visibility and 95% of analytic detections across all 19 steps according to MITRE, offering near real-time insights into threats on servers, laptops and desktop systems to enable detection of credible threats in the customer environment. This cost-efficiency is critical when threats and attack surfaces are growing at a faster pace than security budgets. Also, as threat actors continue to pivot to identity and cloud access vectors, less than 40% of threats investigated by Secureworks today are detectable by endpoint telemetry alone. Security organizations may therefore want to invest more of their resources in other key aspects of threat detection and response — especially XDR, which uses telemetry from the entire enterprise environment to detect and respond to advanced persistent threats (APTs) and other high-stealth exploits. “Given tight budgets and the tremendous undersupply of global cybersecurity talent, Secureworks is committed to making Taegis XDR the industry’s most effective and efficient platform for detecting, investigating and responding to threats across an entire IT and OT landscape,” says Kyle Falkenhagen, Chief Product Officer. “Thanks to our uniquely extensive knowledge of the real-world threat landscape and real-world SecOps practices — as well as our distinctive approach to correlating and prioritizing telemetry from endpoints, networks, clouds, email, identity, OT and business applications — Taegis XDR with our bundled agent is the ideal investment for security teams looking for more signal and less noise.” To learn more about Secureworks Taegis XDR, request a live demo and we can walk through our support of the five evaluated endpoints rated highly in this year’s MITRE Engenuity ATT&CK Evaluation.

Who claimed responsibility for the attack?,"Sign in to PXC > Download now > Sign in > Threat Intelligence Team Threat Intelligence Team Ransomware attacks have shown no signs of slowing down in 2023. A new report from the Malwarebytes Threat Intelligence team shows 1,900 total ransomware attacks within just four countries—the US, Germany, France, and the UK—in one year. The findings, compiled together in the 2023 State of Ransomware Report, show alarming trends in the global ransomware surge from July 2022 to June 2023. For example, the report shows that the US shouldered a hefty 43 percent of all global attacks and that ransomware attacks in France nearly doubled in the last five months. To say ransomware gangs have been unkind to the US in the past year is an understatement. Malwarebytes found that a total of 48 separate ransomware groups attacked the US in the observed period. To boot, there was a 75 percent increase in the average number of monthly attacks in the US between the first and second half of the last 12 months. The UK, on the other hand, emerged as the second-largest ransomware target, enduring close to 200 ransomware attacks. Malwarebytes tracked 32 separate ransomware groups attacking the UK, seven of which recorded more than ten known attacks. In addition, more ransomware gangs are attacking targets multiple times a month: the number of groups carrying out more than one known attack per month in the UK has climbed steadily for a year, from just one in July 2022 to eight in June 2023. Neither France or Germany have been spared by the growing menace of ransomware, either. Germany retained its place as the fourth most attacked country in the world, and the most attacked country outside of the anglosphere. France meanwhile experienced a disproportionately high rate of attacks on its government sector (9 percent of attacks). Perhaps the biggest takeaway from the report, however, is that the ascension of the CL0P group—which has effectively harnessed zero-day vulnerabilities to amplify its attacks—could signal a change in the game. For a year and a half, LockBit, which claims to have 100 affiliates, has been the most dominant form of “Ransomware-as-a-Service” (RaaS) in the US, averaging about 24 attacks per month. However, twice this year, in March and June, LockBit’s considerable rate of attacks was vastly exceeded by CL0P, which was otherwise dormant. The drive behind the sudden change? CL0P used separate zero-days in GoAnywhere MFT and MOVEit Transfer to gain an edge. This gave them the ability to launch an unprecedented number of attacks within a short time frame and across a massive scale. The use of zero-day vulnerabilities by ransomware groups like CL0P may trigger a significant shift in ransomware strategies, mirroring the adoption of the “double extortion” tactic in 2019. If more groups start adopting CL0P’s zero-day exploitation techniques, the ransomware landscape could tilt from service-oriented attacks to a more aggressive, vulnerability-focused model—a move that could skyrocket the number of victims.

Who caused this impact?,"Front page layout Site theme Dan Goodin - Apr 12, 2013 12:00 am UTC Researchers have uncovered an ongoing cyberespionage campaign targeting more than 30 online video game companies over the past four years. The companies infected by the malware primarily market so-called massively multiplayer online role-playing games. They're mostly located in South East Asia, but are also in the US, Germany, Japan, China, Russia, Brazil, Peru, and Belarus, according to a release published Thursday by researchers from antivirus provider Kaspersky Lab. The attackers work from computers with Chinese and Korean language configurations. They used their unauthorized access to obtain digital certificates that were later exploited in malware campaigns targeting other industries and political activists. So far, there's no evidence that customers of the infected game companies were targeted, although in at least one case, malicious code was accidentally installed on gamers' computers by one of the infected victim companies. Kaspersky said there was another case of end users being infected by the malware, which is known as ""Winnti."" The company didn't rule out the possibility that players could be hit in the future, potentially as a result of collateral damage. ""Having infected gaming companies that do business in MMORPG, the attackers potentially get access to millions of users,"" the researchers wrote. ""So far we don't have data that the attackers stole from common users but we do have at least two incidents when Winnti malware had been planted on an online game update server and [this] malicious executable was spread among large number of the game fans. The samples we have observed seemed not to be malware targeted for the game fans but a malware module which accidentally got into [the] wrong place. But a potential of attackers to misuse such access to infect hundreds of millions of Internet users creates a great risk."" Digital certificates stolen in some of the heists have been used to sign malware that targeted Tibetan and Uyghur activists. The cryptographic certificates have also been exploited in attacks that have hit companies in the aerospace industry. Attackers frequently abuse stolen certificates to prevent the malware they're spreading from being detected by various security protections. In addition to stealing digital certificates, the Winnti gang's campaign appears to be motivated by the desire to manipulate in-game currency, such as ""runes"" or ""gold,"" that can in many cases be converted into real currency. The attackers may also want to use source code stolen from the game companies so it can be deployed in rogue servers offering pirated versions of the games. Kaspersky has more here.

Who are the targets of the attack?,"Cisco Talos recently worked with two vendors to patch multiple vulnerabilities in a favored software library used in chemistry laboratories and the Foxit PDF Reader, one of the most popular PDF reader alternatives to Adobe Acrobat. Attackers could exploit these vulnerabilities to carry out a variety of attacks, in some cases gaining the ability to execute remote code on the targeted machine. Seven of the vulnerabilities included in today’s Vulnerability Roundup have a CVSS severity score of 9.8 out of a possible 10. For Snort coverage that can detect the exploitation of these vulnerabilities, download the latest rule sets from Snort.org, and our latest Vulnerability Advisories are always posted on Talos Intelligence’s website. Talos researchers recently discovered multiple vulnerabilities in Open Babel, an open-source software library used in a variety of chemistry and research settings. Open Babel allows users to “search, convert, analyze, or store data from molecular modeling, chemistry, solid-state materials, biochemistry, or related areas,” according to its website, and is used in other popular pieces of software in the science field. Therefore, there are cases where these vulnerabilities are accessible via the internet. The vulnerabilities Talos disclosed to the operators of Open Babel can all be triggered by tricking a user into opening a specially crafted, malformed file. Depending on the platform and on how the code is compiled, these vulnerabilities could lead to arbitrary code execution: Talos is disclosing these vulnerabilities despite no official fix from Open Babel. The vendor declined to release an update within the 90-day period as outlined in Cisco’s vulnerability disclosure policy. Foxit PDF Reader is one of the most popular PDF readers on the market, offering many similar features to Adobe Acrobat. The software also includes a browser extension that allows users to read PDFs right in their web browsers. Talos discovered multiple vulnerabilities in Foxit PDF Reader that could allow an adversary to execute , arbitrary code on the targeted machine. An attacker could exploit these issues by tricking a user into opening a specially crafted PDF document or, if the user has the browser extension enabled, by visiting a malicious web page: Acrobat, one of the most popular PDF readers currently available, contains two out-of-bounds read vulnerabilities that could lead to the exposure of sensitive contents of arbitrary memory in the application. The lone critical security issue is CVE-2024-30044, a remote code execution vulnerability in SharePoint Server. Two vulnerabilities in this group — one in the Tinyroxy HTTP proxy daemon and another in the stb_vorbis.c file library — could lead to arbitrary code execution, earning both issues a CVSS score of 9.8 out of 10. © 2024 Cisco Systems, Inc. and/or its affiliates.

What is a common behavior used by adversaries across different platforms and networks to evade defenses?,"Adversaries may attempt to make an executable or file difficult to discover or analyze by encrypting, encoding, or otherwise obfuscating its contents on the system or in transit. This is common behavior that can be used across different platforms and the network to evade defenses. Payloads may be compressed, archived, or encrypted in order to avoid detection. These payloads may be used during Initial Access or later to mitigate detection. Sometimes a user's action may be required to open and Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information for User Execution. The user may also be required to input a password to open a password protected compressed/encrypted file that was provided by the adversary. [1] Adversaries may also use compressed or archived scripts, such as JavaScript. Portions of files can also be encoded to hide the plain-text strings that would otherwise help defenders with discovery. [2] Payloads may also be split into separate, seemingly benign files that only reveal malicious functionality when reassembled. [3] Adversaries may also abuse Command Obfuscation to obscure commands executed from payloads or directly via Command and Scripting Interpreter. Environment variables, aliases, characters, and other platform/language specific semantics can be used to evade signature based detections and application control mechanisms.

Consider utilizing the Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI) on Windows 10+ to analyze commands after being processed/interpreted. [175] Consider periodic review of common fileless storage locations (such as the Registry or WMI repository) to potentially identify abnormal and malicious data. On Windows 10+, enable Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) rules to prevent execution of potentially obfuscated payloads. [176] Ensure that a finite amount of ingress points to a software deployment system exist with restricted access for those required to allow and enable newly deployed software. Monitor executed commands and arguments for indicators of obfuscation and potentially suspicious syntax such as uninterpreted escape characters (e.g., ^). Also monitor command-lines for syntax-specific signs of obfuscation, such as variations of arguments associated with encoding. Detection of file obfuscation is difficult unless artifacts are left behind by the obfuscation process that are uniquely detectable with a signature. If detection of the obfuscation itself is not possible, it may be possible to detect the malicious activity that caused the obfuscated file (for example, the method that was used to write, read, or modify the file on the file system). Monitor for contextual data about a file, which may include information such as name, the content (ex: signature, headers, or data/media), user/owner, permissions, etc. File-based signatures may be capable of detecting code obfuscation depending on the methods used.[177][178][179] Monitoring module loads, especially those not explicitly included in import tables, may highlight obfuscated code functionality. Dynamic malware analysis may also expose signs of code obfuscation.[178] Monitor and analyze calls to functions such as GetProcAddress() that are associated with malicious code obfuscation.[177] Monitor for newly executed processes that may attempt to make an executable or file difficult to discover or analyze by encrypting, encoding, or otherwise obfuscating its contents on the system or in transit. Monitor executed scripts for indicators of obfuscation and potentially suspicious command syntax, such as uninterpreted escape characters (e.g., ^). Also monitor commands within scripts for syntax-specific signs of obfuscation, such as encoded or otherwise unreadable blobs of characters. Monitor for the creation of Registry values that may highlight storage of malicious data such as commands or payloads. Monitor for the creation of WMI Objects and values that may highlight storage of malicious data such as commands or payloads.","A common behavior used by adversaries to evade defenses across different platforms and networks is the obfuscation of executables or files. This can be achieved by encrypting, encoding, or otherwise obfuscating the contents of the system or in transit. Payloads may be compressed, archived, or encrypted to avoid detection. These payloads may be used during initial access or later to mitigate detection. Sometimes, a user’s action may be required to open and deobfuscate/decode files or information for user execution."

Archived News Para Notícias en Español The Justice Department today announced an effort to disrupt a global botnet of hundreds of thousands of infected home and office (SOHO) routers and other networked devices under the control of a group of actors known as the “Sofacy Group” (also known as “apt28,” “sandworm,” “x-agent,” “pawn storm,” “fancy bear” and “sednit”).  The group, which has been operating since at least in or about 2007, targets government, military, security organizations, and other targets of perceived intelligence value. Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers, U.S. Attorney Scott W. Brady for the Western District of Pennsylvania, Assistant Director Scott Smith for the FBI’s Cyber Division, FBI Special Agent in Charge Robert Johnson of the Pittsburgh Division and FBI Special Agent in Charge David J. LeValley of the Atlanta Division made the announcement. “The Department of Justice is committed to disrupting, not just watching, national security cyber threats using every tool at our disposal, and today’s effort is another example of our commitment to do that,” said Assistant Attorney General Demers.  “This operation is the first step in the disruption of a botnet that provides the Sofacy actors with an array of capabilities that could be used for a variety of malicious purposes, including intelligence gathering, theft of valuable information, destructive or disruptive attacks, and the misattribution of such activities.” “The United States Attorney’s Office will continue to aggressively fight against threats to our national security by criminals, no matter who they work for” said U.S. Attorney Brady.  “This court-ordered seizure will assist in the identification of victim devices and disrupts the ability of these hackers to steal personal and other sensitive information and carry out disruptive cyber attacks.  We will be relentless in protecting the people of Western Pennsylvania - from international corporations to local businesses to the elderly - from these threats.” “Today's announcement highlights the FBI's ability to take swift action in the fight against cybercrime and our commitment to protecting the American people and their devices,” said Assistant Director Scott Smith. “By seizing a domain used by malicious cyber actors in their botnet campaign, the FBI has taken a critical step in minimizing the impact of the malware attack. While this is an important first step, the FBI's work is not done. The FBI, along with our domestic and international partners, will continue our efforts to identify and expose those responsible for this wave of malware.” “The FBI will not allow malicious cyber actors, regardless of whether they are state-sponsored, to operate freely,” said FBI Special Agent in Charge Bob Johnson. “These hackers are exploiting vulnerabilities and putting every American’s privacy and network security at risk. Although there is still much to be learned about how this particular threat initially compromises infected routers and other devices, we encourage citizens and businesses to keep their network equipment updated and to change default passwords.” “This action by the FBI, DOJ, and our partners should send a clear message to our adversaries that the U.S. Government will take action to mitigate the threats posed by them and to protect our citizens and our allies even when the possibility of arrest and prosecution may not be readily available,” said FBI Special Agent in Charge David J. LeValley. “As our adversaries’ technical capabilities evolve, the FBI and its partners will continue to rise to the challenge, placing themselves between the adversaries and their intended victims.” The botnet, referred to by the FBI and cyber security researchers as “VPNFilter,” targets SOHO routers and network-access storage (NAS) devices, which are hardware devices made up of several hard drives used to store data in a single location that can be accessed by multiple users.  The VPNFilter botnet uses several stages of malware. Although the second stage of malware, which has the malicious capabilities described above, can be cleared from a device by rebooting it, the first stage of malware persists through a reboot, making it difficult to prevent reinfection by the second stage. In order to identify infected devices and facilitate their remediation, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Pennsylvania applied for and obtained court orders, authorizing the FBI to seize a domain that is part of the malware’s command-and-control infrastructure.  This will redirect attempts by stage one of the malware to reinfect the device to an FBI-controlled server, which will capture the Internet Protocol (IP) address of infected devices, pursuant to legal process. A non-profit partner organization, The Shadowserver Foundation, will disseminate the IP addresses to those who can assist with remediating the VPNFilter botnet, including foreign CERTs and internet service providers (ISPs).   Owners of SOHO and NAS devices that may be infected should reboot their devices as soon as possible,  temporarily eliminating the second stage malware and causing the first stage malware on their device to call out for instructions.  Although devices will remain vulnerable to reinfection with the second stage malware while connected to the Internet, these efforts maximize opportunities to identify and remediate the infection worldwide in the time available before Sofacy actors learn of the vulnerability in their command-and-control infrastructure. The FBI and the Department of Homeland Security have also jointly notified trusted ISPs.  The Department and the FBI also encourage users and administrators to review the Cisco blog post on VPNFilter, available HERE, for recommendations and to ensure that their devices are updated with the latest patches. The efforts to disrupt the VPNFilter botnet were led by the FBI’s Pittsburgh and Atlanta Offices; FBI Cyber Division;  Trial Attorney Matthew Chang of the National Security Division’s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section; and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Charles Eberle and Soo C. Song of the Western District Pennsylvania.  Critical assistance was also provided by Richard Green of the Criminal Division’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section and The Shadowserver Foundation.

What are some of the security measures that businesses can implement to protect against Magecart attacks?,"Magecart attacks, also known as digital skimming or e-skimming, involve the exfiltration of payment information and other customer data from businesses selling goods or services via their websites. In these attacks, malicious actors inject code into checkout pages, allowing them to “skim” credit card details entered by users in HTML forms. The stolen credit card information is then either used by the attackers or sold on the dark web. These attacks have affected numerous e-commerce sites, including British Airways and Ticketmaster. The Magecart software, used by various hacking groups, aims to steal payment details by injecting malicious code into e-commerce sites. It’s essential for businesses to implement security measures like Subresource Integrity, Content Security Policy, and web application firewalls to protect against formjacking and supply chain attacks.","Businesses can implement security measures like Subresource Integrity, Content Security Policy, and web application firewalls to protect against Magecart attacks, which involve digital skimming or e-skimming.
